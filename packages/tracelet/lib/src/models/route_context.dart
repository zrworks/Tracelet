/// route context is **captured once at insert time** and travels with the
/// location row through the sync queue — even if the app changes context
/// (e.g. switches tasks) before the batch is drained.

/// // Later, switch to a new task — queued points keep the old context
/// await Tracelet.setRouteContext(RouteContext(
///   taskId: 'delivery-43',
///   driverId: 'driver-7',
