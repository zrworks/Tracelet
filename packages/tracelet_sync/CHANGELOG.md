## 3.2.10

 - Update a dependency to the latest release.

## 3.2.9

- **FIX**(ios): Remove `TraceletCore+Dummy.swift` / `TraceletSyncFFI+Dummy.swift` — `@_silgen_name` declarations from the old static library model caused "Undefined symbol" linker errors after the static→dynamic xcframework migration.
- **FIX**(android): Catch `ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException` in `LocationService.start()` so calling `ready()` from the background on Android 12+ no longer crashes the host app; the foreground service start is deferred until the app returns to foreground.


## 3.2.8

- **FIX**: Persist geofence ENTER/EXIT events in offline queue and auto-sync to server — events were previously dispatched to the app but never stored in the local SQLite database (Issue #128).
- **FIX**: Structured event envelope (`event_type`, `event_payload`) for geofence events round-trips correctly through `getLocations()` and `insertLocation()`.
- **FIX**(sync): Stop POSTing malformed error payloads on failed HTTP sync requests; fix iOS custom-body deadlock in `setSyncBodyBuilder` (Issue #125).
- **FIX**(android): Throw `NOT_READY` error before `ready()` is called to match iOS parity; previously Android silently ignored SDK calls before initialization (Issue #129).
- **FIX**(ios): Resolve `flutter_rust_bridge has not been initialized` on release builds — `TraceletCore` is now a dynamic framework, preventing dead-code stripping of FRB symbols (Issues #116, #123, #124).
- **FIX**(android): Resolve `Failed to lookup symbol 'frb_get_rust_content_hash'` — Rust symbols are now loaded directly from `libtracelet_core.so` bypassing `RTLD_LOCAL` isolation (Issues #116, #123).
- **PERF**(ios): Reduce background motion sensor CPU/battery usage — accelerometer polling is now paused when stationary (Issue #130).
- **FIX**: Persist historical `is_moving` state per location record so `getLocations()` returns accurate values instead of always returning the current live state (Issue #126).

## 3.2.7

- **FIX**(ios): prevent dead code stripping of flutter_rust_bridge symbols in release builds.
- **FIX**(android): implement OEM hardening mitigations and introduce `showPowerManager` to handle aggressive battery restrictions on specific OEM devices.

## 3.2.6

- **PERF**: Optimize database timestamp queries for O(log N) fast filtering and resolve precision bugs (Issue #119).
- **FEAT**: Implement `sslPinningFingerprints` natively across iOS and Android with Rust configs.
- **FIX**: Include pinned fingerprints in SSL verification error logs and messages.
- **FIX**: Rate limit Android MotionDetector logcat flooding during stillness (Issue #121).
- **FIX**: Resolve race conditions in tests for Issue 118.
- **REFACTOR**: Update integration test to use Config.fromMap for comprehensive Tracelet configuration testing.

## 3.2.4

* **FIX**(ios): safely resolve dynamic symbols when `use_frameworks! :linkage => :dynamic` is used.

## 3.2.3

- **FIX**: Force speed motion manager to evaluate initial speed on Android to prevent the state machine from being permanently stuck in `MOVING` when indoors ([#115](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/115)).
- **FIX**: Resolve `flutter_rust_bridge has not been initialized` crash by ensuring the Rust core is instantiated and initialized before accessing methods ([#116](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/116)).
- **CHORE**: Sync release versions across all packages.

## 3.2.2

- **CHORE**: Sync release versions across all federated packages and update Swift Package Manager configuration.

## 3.2.1

- **CHORE**: Align federated package versions and include additional patch updates.

## 3.2.0

* Initial release.
* Extracted from the core tracelet package to reduce baseline bundle size.
* Native LocationDataSink integration for zero-wake offline persistence.
