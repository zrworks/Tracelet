/// Manages a `CLServiceSession` (iOS 18+) to maintain the app's location
/// authorization state across background transitions and app relaunches.
///
/// ## Purpose
///
/// `CLServiceSession` is Apple's iOS 18+ mechanism for declaring that the
/// app has an ongoing need for location authorization. While a service
/// session is active:
///
/// - The system preserves the app's authorization level across app
///   lifecycle events (suspension, termination, relaunch).
///
/// - If "Always" authorization is granted, the app continues to receive
///   location callbacks even after being relaunched in the background.
///
/// - The session survives app restarts — if the app is killed and
///   relaunched (e.g., via significant-location change), creating a new
///   `CLServiceSession` re-establishes the authorization context.
///
/// ## Relationship to Other Mechanisms
///
/// - **`CLBackgroundActivitySession`**: Declares "I am doing background
///   location work RIGHT NOW." Auto-shows the blue indicator.
///
/// - **`CLServiceSession`**: Declares "I NEED location authorization to
///   remain valid." Does NOT auto-show the indicator.
///
/// Both can be active simultaneously and serve complementary purposes.
///
/// ## Behavior on iOS < 18
///
/// This manager is a no-op. Authorization state is managed differently
/// on older iOS versions (via `CLLocationManager` authorization APIs).
