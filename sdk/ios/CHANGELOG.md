# Changelog

## 3.0.1

- **CHORE**: Version bump for monorepo consistency with Flutter plugins (resolves SPM FlutterFramework missing dependency in wrapper).

## 3.0.0

- **FEAT**: Massive Architecture Rewrite — Core algorithms are now powered by a high-performance **Rust Core** using `flutter_rust_bridge`.
- **FEAT**: Smart Motion Mode — Introduced `MotionDetectionMode.smart` powered by the Rust battery budget engine.

## 2.1.0

- **CHORE**: Major release synchronized with Tracelet Flutter 2.1.0.
- **FEAT**: Implemented `SpeedMotionManager` for the new `tl.MotionDetectionMode.speed` tracking mode, exclusively using GPS speed variations for motion state transitions.
- **FIX**: Prevented a critical logic flaw where the accelerometer was completely shut down during the `stopTimeout` countdown. Motion during the countdown now correctly aborts the stationary transition (#85).
- **FIX**: Reset `TraceletHasRequestedAlways` flag upon iOS `notDetermined` state to prevent native prompt bypasses after the app is reinstalled.
- **REFACTOR**: Transitioned all string-based config values to type-safe Enums across the platform bridge.

## 2.0.7

- **FIX**: Resolved an issue where low-confidence Activity Recognition updates were ignored by the Dart event stream but were still silently updating the internal state machine, causing subsequent high-confidence updates to be dispatched as spurious "changes" even when the activity type hadn't actually changed.
- **FIX**: Resolved a bug where the `stopTimer` countdown (for transitioning from moving to stationary) was being incorrectly reset on every `CMMotionActivity` update. This caused the SDK to get stuck in the `moving` state because the countdown timer never had a chance to reach zero.

## 2.0.6

- **FIX**: Resolved critical issue where calculated `BatteryBudgetEngine` parameter adjustments (distance filter, accuracy) were not applied to `LocationEngine`.
- **FEAT**: Added "Charging Bypass" to skip battery budgeting updates while connected to external power.
- **PERF**: Implemented heartbeat deduplication, saving hundreds of redundant SQLite inserts/hour when stationary by tracking last persisted location timestamps.
- **FIX**: Corrected `stillSampleCount` dwell window regression to match the actual 10Hz accelerometer rate (reduced stationary delay from 15s to 5s).
- **FIX**: Added permission-missing checks and explicit feedback via `providerChange` events on `start()` call.

## 2.0.5

- **CHORE**: Bump version to 2.0.5 to align with federated Flutter packages and coordinated monorepo release.

## 2.0.3

- **FIX**: Remove unreliable iOS timestamp drift heuristic that could cause false mock detection flags due to device-network clock drift.

## 2.0.2

- **FIX**: `deferTime` is now accounted for in the heuristic mock detection drift calculation. Deferred locations are no longer incorrectly flagged as mock locations.
- **FIX**: Refactored `TraceletConfigTests.swift` to match the current configuration structure.

## 2.0.1

- **FIX**: Fixed persistent blue location indicator by properly conditionally disabling `CLBackgroundActivitySession` and `startUpdatingLocation()` in low-accuracy geofence-only mode.
- **FIX**: `TraceletSdk.startGeofences()` now properly cleans up `CLBackgroundActivitySession` if switching from high to low accuracy.

## 2.0.0

- **CHORE**: Major release synchronized with Tracelet Flutter 2.0.0.
- **FEAT**: Added `shakeThreshold`, `stillThreshold`, and `stillSampleCount` to `MotionConfig` for granular accelerometer tuning.
- **CHORE**: Aligned versioning across the entire Tracelet monorepo.

## 1.1.4

- **CHORE**: Aligned repository podspec files and updated release documentation.
- **CHORE**: Maintenance release to sync native SDK versions.

## 1.1.3

- **FIX**: Aligned `sdk/ios/TraceletSDK.podspec` with root production podspec.
- **FIX**: Updated license to Apache-2.0 and included missing frameworks (CoreMotion, BackgroundTasks, AVFoundation, AudioToolbox, DeviceCheck) and sqlite3 library.
- **FIX**: Synchronized release versioning with Android and Flutter monorepo.

## 1.0.11

- **PERF**: `LocationEngine.changePace(true)` now fires an additional one-shot `requestLocation()` on stationary → moving transitions, delivering a fresh GPS fix as soon as the hardware is warm without waiting for `distanceFilter` to be satisfied on the continuous stream. Reduces first-fix latency on motion start from 11–50s to ~1–5s (#54).

## 1.0.10

- **FIX**: Version bump for parity with Android SDK 1.0.10 (killed-state tracking fix #50).

## 1.0.9

- **FEAT**: Add `getSyncInterval()` to `ConfigManager` and timer-based sync to `HttpSyncManager` (#50).

## 1.0.8

- **FIX**: Fix `SubsystemTests` — use `HttpSyncManager.onRequestFreshHeaders` (static type) instead of instance access.

## 1.0.7

- **CHORE**: Re-release — 1.0.6 was published alongside partially-released Flutter packages.

## 1.0.6

- **FIX**: `getCurrentPosition(samples: 1)` routes through `collectSamples` using `startUpdatingLocation` instead of `CLLocationManager.requestLocation()` — forces a fresh GPS fix with proper timeout instead of returning stale cached locations (#46).
- **PERF**: Remove per-batch `onRequestFreshHeaders` invocation from `HttpSyncManager.syncBatch()` — eliminates unnecessary callback overhead. Token refresh handled reactively via `onAuthorizationRequired` on 401.
- **FIX**: Relax `isReady` guards to `manager != nil` for privacy zones, audit trail, and encryption — these features only need DB init, not active tracking.

## 1.0.5

- **FIX**: `getCurrentPosition()` / `collectSamples()` / `didFailWithError` fall back to last known location when `CLLocationManager` returns no fix — fixes `LOCATION_UNAVAILABLE` on simulators and GPS-off devices (#46).

## 1.0.4

- **CHORE**: Version bump for strict dependency pinning in Flutter wrapper.

## 1.0.3

- **FIX**: Add `isReady` guards to **all** SDK methods that access subsystem properties — prevents crash when any method is called before `ready()`, not just `stop()` (re-fixes #46).
- **FIX**: `getState()` returns a safe default disabled state before `ready()` instead of crashing.
- **FIX**: `setConfig()`, `reset()`, `getLog()`, `playSound()`, `getSensors()`, all geofence/location/persistence/sync/schedule/privacy-zone/audit-trail methods now guard against pre-ready access.

## 1.0.2

- **FIX**: `TraceletSdk.stop()` now checks `isReady` before accessing managers — prevents crash when `stop()` is called before `ready()` (fixes #46).

## 1.0.1

- Initial release on CocoaPods.
