## 3.3.2

 - Update a dependency to the latest release.

## 3.3.1

* **FIX** (Crash detection, Android/iOS): Confirmed `crash`/`fall` events are no longer lost when tracking stops right after the impact (the common crash → vehicle-at-rest → `stopTimeout` case). The confirmation countdown now runs independently of tracking state and self-terminates when no candidate is pending ([#169](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/169)).
* **FIX** (Crash detection): The effective crash g-threshold matched the documented value — the confidence gate previously raised a 3.0 g threshold to ~3.6 g, increasing false negatives ([#170](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/170)).
* **FIX** (Crash detection): A single crash (primary spike + bounce/secondary impacts) no longer raises multiple candidates; a refractory period debounces one event into one prompt ([#171](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/171)).
* **IMPROVE** (Crash detection, Android/iOS): When crash/fall detection is enabled, the accelerometer is sampled at a higher rate (Android `SENSOR_DELAY_GAME` + no batch latency; iOS 100 Hz) so short impact peaks (~50–150 ms) are actually captured instead of missed between motion-detection samples ([#172](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/172)). Roadmap for research-grade robustness (Δv, sensor fusion, free-fall signature, process-death survival): [#173](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/173).

## 3.3.0

* **FIX** (Audit, Android/iOS): The tamper-proof audit chain only covered locations that flowed through the foreground location dispatcher. Background/headless persists (periodic worker, location service, killed-state relaunch, geofence events) wrote location rows with **no** matching audit-trail link, so `getAuditProof()` returned `null` for those records even with audit enabled. Audit links are now generated at the single persistence chokepoint, so **every** persisted location is chained regardless of source. Chain mutation is also now thread-safe.
* **FIX** (Audit, iOS): `appendToChain` no longer creates an audit row for records without a `uuid` (it previously used an empty string). Such orphan rows had no retrievable location and made `verifyAuditTrail()` report the whole chain as *broken* ("missing location record"). uuid-less records are now skipped on both platforms. The audit hash version was bumped (auto-resets any orphaned/incomplete chains from the prior logic on first launch).
* **FEAT** (Battery, Android): Motion-gated wakelock — drop the OEM partial wakelock when stationary and re-assert it on movement, via `AndroidConfig.releaseWakelockWhenStationary` (opt-in, default off; gated on the hardware significant-motion wake sensor) ([#162](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/162)).
* **FEAT** (Driving & Safety): On-device driving-behavior telematics — `harsh_braking` / `harsh_acceleration` / `harsh_cornering` / `speeding` via `TelematicsConfig` + `Tracelet.onDrivingEvent` (opt-in, default off) ([#163](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/163)).
* **FEAT** (Driving & Safety): On-device transport-mode classifier (still/walking/running/cycling/vehicle) fusing accelerometer + GPS via `ClassifierConfig` + `Tracelet.onModeChange` ([#164](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/164)).
* **FEAT** (Driving & Safety): Crash & fall detection with a cancel-countdown confirmation flow via `ImpactConfig` + `Tracelet.onImpact` and `Tracelet.confirmImpact` / `Tracelet.cancelImpact` (opt-in, default off) ([#165](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/165)).
* All three features are **default-off** and side-channel — no change to existing tracking when disabled. See [Driving & Safety](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/blob/main/help/DRIVING-AND-SAFETY.md).

## 3.2.19

**CHORE**: version bump for patch release

## 3.2.18

* **FIX** (Native): `ready()` / `getState()` now populate `State.config` with the active configuration instead of leaving it permanently `null` ([#147](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/147)).
* **FEAT**: Add `HttpConfig.syncInterval` for interval-based sync — the documented repeating-timer cadence was missing from the Dart config and the Pigeon layer; the native interval timer now flushes the offline queue on this cadence ([#149](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/149)).
* **FIX** (Native): `destroySyncedLocations()` returns the real number of synced-and-pruned locations instead of a hardcoded `0` stub ([#154](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/154)).
* **FEAT**: Expose the offline queue with `getPendingLocations()` and `getPendingLocationCount()` ([#159](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/159)).
* **FIX** (Native): Honor the `useKalmanFilter` config key so the Extended Kalman Filter is no longer silently disabled by a key mismatch ([#148](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/148)).
* **FIX** (Native): Propagate the detected activity (walking / driving / still) into recorded locations — fixes a permanent `"activity": "unknown"` ([#155](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/155)).
* **FIX** (Native): Rebuild the native location processor when `ready()` applies a new config, so settings such as `distanceFilter` take effect immediately instead of using stale defaults ([#157](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/157)).
* **FIX** (Native): `getCount()` honors time-bound queries instead of always returning the whole-database total ([#152](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/152)).
* **FIX**: Guard the `AuditConfig` hash-algorithm mapping so configuring `sha384` / `sha512` no longer crashes with a fatal `RangeError` during `ready()` — unsupported variants fall back to `sha256` ([#150](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/150)).
* **FIX** (Native): The HTTP sync payload now includes each point's motion state `is_moving` ([#151](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/151)) and its trigger `event` (location / motionchange / heartbeat / geofence) ([#156](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/156)) — both were previously omitted by the native sync record.

## 3.2.17

* **FIX** (Native): Resolve iOS auto-sync thread starvation by offloading synchronous HTTP requests to a background DispatchQueue to prevent blocking Swift Concurrency pools ([#146](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/146)).
* **CHORE** (Docs): Fix Nextra changelog rendering bug and improve auto-translation glossary script for internationalization.

## 3.2.16

* **FIX** (Native): Resolve Android/iOS getting stuck in the moving state and never transitioning back to stationary, which kept continuous GPS active and drained the battery. The accelerometer stillness sampler now stays active during the stop-timeout countdown and requires sustained motion — rather than a single noisy or stale sample — to abort it ([#142](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/142)).
* **FIX** (Native): Background and post-reboot location captures are persisted (and therefore synced) again. Headless tracking (killed-state relaunch / boot) never calls `ready()`, so an internal readiness guard silently dropped every captured location before it reached the database, leaving auto-sync with nothing to upload.
* **FIX** (Android): The foreground-service notification now reliably appears when the app is backgrounded or terminated with `showNotificationOnPauseOnly` enabled. The app's own foreground service skewed foreground/background detection (and OS process-importance updates lag), so the pause-only notification was suppressed even though tracking and syncing continued.

## 3.2.15

* **FIX** (Native): Allow `getState()` and `stop()` to be called before `ready()` is invoked, correctly reporting persistent state and shutting down background services if the app was restarted from a killed state.
* **CHORE**: Update dependencies and constraints.
* **FIX**: Resolve `MissingPluginException` and test timing issues with `setHasCustomSyncBodyBuilder`.

## 3.2.14

 - **FIX**(sync): keep method channel alive to avoid iOS timeout bugs when no builder is registered. ([9a083478](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/9a083478733315922245fc82c36bada011378818))
 - **FIX**(sync): resolve issue 134 where custom sync body timeouts prevented background syncs. ([7fa16fdf](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/7fa16fdf05274c326f6b6b29d318f55981232f1a))
 - **FIX**(sync): fix background auto-sync abortion when no custom builder is registered (Issue [#134](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/134)). ([631542a1](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/631542a1c89cece565160966c6f6301a0e18098a))
 - **DOCS**: add official documentation URL to all package READMEs. ([9eb6951e](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/9eb6951e64c13007f3264e2d44f0feb9222500a3))
 - **DOCS**: integrate nextra website and update pubspec URLs. ([99b7fda8](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/99b7fda82e290ca6c8175313eae62a2475360050))

## 3.2.13

- **FIX**(android): `startOnBoot` now resumes tracking after a reboot on devices where the OS refuses to start a `location` foreground service from `BOOT_COMPLETED` (e.g. Android 14). Previously tracking silently never resumed after a reboot; it now falls back to background WorkManager/alarm tracking.
- **FIX**(android): HTTP sync now works headlessly after a reboot — background sync can refresh an expiring auth token and build a custom sync body without the app being opened. Previously the headless Dart sync bridge was only wired when a UI engine attached, so post-reboot sync used a stale token (or the wrong payload) until the app was launched.

## 3.2.12

- **CHORE**: Re-release to align the full federated package set and native SDKs to a single consistent version. The 3.2.11 release published with mismatched versions across some packages (a few resolved to 3.2.10). No functional code changes.

## 3.2.11

- **FIX**: Custom sync-body builder now falls back to the headless engine on timeout (instead of aborting the sync) on both Android and iOS — fixes location sync stopping after a few minutes in the background when using `setSyncBodyBuilder` (Issue #134).

## 3.2.10

 - **FIX**: streamline geofence event payload handling in fromMap method.
 - **FIX**: ensure geofence action (ENTER/EXIT/DWELL) is correctly parsed from nested payloads on all platforms and update CI to scan dynamic frameworks for symbols.

## 3.2.9

- **FIX**(ios): Remove `TraceletCore+Dummy.swift` / `TraceletSyncFFI+Dummy.swift` — `@_silgen_name` declarations from the old static library model caused "Undefined symbol" linker errors after the static→dynamic xcframework migration.
- **FIX**(android): Catch `ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException` in `LocationService.start()` so calling `ready()` from the background on Android 12+ no longer crashes the host app; the foreground service start is deferred until the app returns to foreground.


## 3.2.8

- **FIX**: Persist geofence ENTER/EXIT events in offline queue and auto-sync to server — events were previously dispatched to the app but never stored in the local SQLite database (Issue #128).
- **FIX**: Structured event envelope (`event_type`, `event_payload`) for geofence events round-trips correctly through `getLocations()` and `insertLocation()`.
- **FIX**(sync): Stop POSTing malformed error payloads on failed HTTP sync requests; fix iOS custom-body deadlock in `setSyncBodyBuilder` (Issue #125).
- **FIX**(android): Throw `NOT_READY` error before `ready()` is called to match iOS parity; previously Android silently ignored SDK calls before initialization (Issue #129).
- **FIX**(ios): Resolve `flutter_rust_bridge has not been initialized` on release builds — `TraceletCore` is now a dynamic framework, preventing dead-code stripping of FRB symbols (Issues #116, #123, #124).
- **FIX**(android): Resolve `Failed to lookup symbol 'frb_get_rust_content_hash'` — Rust symbols are now loaded directly from `libtracelet_core.so` bypassing `RTLD_LOCAL` isolation (Issues #116, #123).
- **PERF**(ios): Reduce background motion sensor CPU/battery usage — accelerometer polling is now paused when stationary (Issue #130).
- **FIX**: Persist historical `is_moving` state per location record so `getLocations()` returns accurate values instead of always returning the current live state (Issue #126).

## 3.2.7

- **FIX**(ios): prevent dead code stripping of flutter_rust_bridge symbols in release builds.
- **FIX**(android): implement OEM hardening mitigations and introduce `showPowerManager` to handle aggressive battery restrictions on specific OEM devices.

## 3.2.6

- **PERF**: Optimize database timestamp queries for O(log N) fast filtering and resolve precision bugs (Issue #119).
- **FEAT**: Implement `sslPinningFingerprints` natively across iOS and Android with Rust configs.
- **FIX**: Include pinned fingerprints in SSL verification error logs and messages.
- **FIX**: Rate limit Android MotionDetector logcat flooding during stillness (Issue #121).
- **FIX**: Resolve race conditions in tests for Issue 118.
- **REFACTOR**: Update integration test to use Config.fromMap for comprehensive Tracelet configuration testing.

## 3.2.5
- **FIX**: Resolved iOS accelerometer sensitivity mismatch (stationary lock) by normalizing incoming m/s² thresholds to g-force expected by CMMotionManager.
- **FIX**: Unify motion detection initial state and resume behavior across Android and iOS, preventing incorrect forced states on app launch and correctly resuming saved states.
- **FIX**: Resolved `flutter_rust_bridge` dynamic library load failures on release builds for users without `use_frameworks!` by preserving global symbols during Xcode stripping.

## 3.2.4

* **FIX**(ios): safely resolve dynamic symbols when `use_frameworks! :linkage => :dynamic` is used.

## 3.2.3

- **FIX**: Force speed motion manager to evaluate initial speed on Android to prevent the state machine from being permanently stuck in `MOVING` when indoors ([#115](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/115)).
- **FIX**: Resolve `flutter_rust_bridge has not been initialized` crash by ensuring the Rust core is instantiated and initialized before accessing methods ([#116](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/116)).
- **CHORE**: Sync release versions across all packages.

## 3.2.2

- **CHORE**: Sync release versions across all federated packages and update Swift Package Manager configuration.

## 3.2.1

- **CHORE**: Align federated package versions and include additional patch updates.

## 3.2.0

- **FEAT**: Added `autoSyncDelay` to `HttpConfig` — configure the debounce delay in milliseconds before automatically dispatching an HTTP sync request after a location is recorded.
- **FEAT**: Introduced new `tracelet_sync` package for offline SQLite persistence and automatic HTTP synchronization.
- **FEAT**: Add reverse geocoding (`resolveAddress`) functionality for automatic address lookups.

## 3.1.14

- **FIX**(ios): prevent dead code stripping of flutter_rust_bridge symbols in SPM apps by referencing them explicitly in TraceletIosPlugin

## 3.1.10

 - Bump \"tracelet\" to `3.1.10`.

## 3.1.9

- **FIX**(android): conditionally apply kotlin-android plugin to support older flutter SDKs while preventing warnings in modern Flutter environments.
- **CHORE**(ci): add strict pre-publish flutter build verification step to `release.yml`.

## 3.1.8

- Fix iOS SPM publishing

## 3.1.7

 - **FIX**(android): apply kotlin-android plugin to fix gradle build errors on newer AGP versions.
 - **FIX**(ios): fix SPM source folder paths in release bundling to ensure SDK compiles properly via CocoaPods.
 - **FIX**(ios): fix duplicate module import errors by adding conditional import checks for TraceletSDK.

## 3.1.4

**FEAT**: Major architectural upgrade: Unified Rust Core.
- The heavy lifting for Geofences, Privacy Zones, Audit Trail, and SQLite persistence has been moved to a shared Rust core (`tracelet_core`).
- Guarantees 100% mathematical and behavioral parity between iOS and Android.
- Eliminates subtle cross-platform inconsistencies in geofence ray-casting and proximity evaluation.
- Native SDK wrappers (Swift/Kotlin) have been thinned out to act purely as FFI bridges via UniFFI.

**FEAT**: Introduced explicit predefined tracking profiles: `Config.highAccuracy()`, `Config.balanced()`, and `Config.lowPower()` to simplify setup.

**CHORE**: Release strategy overhaul. The iOS Rust Core is now bundled directly into the `tracelet_ios` plugin for pub.dev publication, while the Android SDK continues to be distributed via Maven Central.

## 3.0.1

- **FIX**(ios): Add missing `FlutterFramework` dependency to SPM plugin configuration to resolve compilation failures and `PlatformException`s.

## 3.0.0

### 🎉 Major Features & Improvements
- **FEAT**: Massive Architecture Rewrite — Core algorithms (Location Filtering, Kalman Filter, Trip Management, Battery Budgeting, Schedule Parsing, Delta Encoding, Audit Trail) are now powered by a high-performance **Rust Core** using `flutter_rust_bridge` and `UniFFI`. This brings identically deterministic behavior and extreme battery efficiency across Android, iOS, and Dart.
- **FEAT**: Smart Motion Mode — Introduced `MotionDetectionMode.smart`. This intelligent hybrid detection mode optimizes battery consumption dynamically by delegating evaluation to the Rust battery budget engine.
- **FEAT**: Event bridge overhaul — Migrated all platform event channels to use strongly-typed Pigeon bridges, eliminating JSON serialization overhead completely.
- **FEAT**: New Ecosystem Adapters — Introduced the official `tracelet_supabase` (Supabase Postgres background syncing & Auth) and `tracelet_firebase` (Firebase RTDB live location broadcasting) plugins.

## 2.1.0

### 🎉 Major Features & Improvements
- **FEAT**: Smart Foreground Notification Visibility (Android) — Added dynamic foreground service notification management. The notification now intelligently hides itself when the app is in the foreground, and reappears seamlessly when the app enters the background. This significantly reduces notification clutter while maintaining OS-level compliance.
- **FEAT**: Speed-Based Motion Detection Mode — Introduced a new motion detection mode (`tl.MotionDetectionMode.speed`). In this mode, motion state transitions are driven directly by GPS speed calculations rather than raw accelerometer hardware. This provides enhanced compatibility and reliability on devices with aggressive sensor sleep policies, particularly in vehicular tracking scenarios.
- **FEAT**: Strongly-Typed Enums Across Bridge — Fully refactored string-based config comparisons to typed enum indices across the Flutter, Pigeon, Android, and iOS layers. This eliminates magic strings and ensures type-safety across the entire plugin bridge.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **FIX (Core)**: Fixed Accelerometer "Deaf Period" During Stop Countdown — Fixed a critical flaw in both Android and iOS native SDKs where the accelerometer was completely shut down during the `stopTimeout` countdown. Previously, if the device was still for 5 seconds on a smooth road, it would begin the 60-second stop countdown and ignore any subsequent bumps or shakes. Now, the accelerometer remains active during the countdown and will correctly abort the stationary transition if motion resumes ([#85](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/85)).
- **FIX (iOS)**: Resolved Native Permission Prompt Loop — Fixed an issue where reinstalling the app on iOS would bypass the native "Change to Always Allow" permission dialog and incorrectly redirect users to the iOS Settings app. `TraceletHasRequestedAlways` is now properly reset upon `notDetermined` OS state.
- **FIX (Core)**: Corrected Exponential Retry Backoff Scaling — Fixed a critical unit discrepancy between Dart and Swift for `retryBackoffCap` and `retryBackoffBase`. Time values are now properly cast as milliseconds instead of seconds, resolving a severe bug where HTTP retries fired every 60ms during network failure, causing excessive CPU/network thrashing and a massive 58KB+ log flood.
- **FIX (Core)**: Resolved Location Stream Dropping Events — Refactored the core `Tracelet.locationStream` pipeline. Replaced the faulty `asyncMap` batch processing with a highly robust `.expand()` implementation. The `Tracelet.locationStream` now correctly parses, type-casts, and guarantees delivery of every individual `Location` object without throwing `type '_Map<Object?, Object?>' is not a subtype of type 'Map<String, dynamic>'` or silently discarding valid coordinates.
- **FIX (Android)**: Prevent `LocationEngine.stop` from unintentionally overriding the global `stateManager.enabled` flag during speed-based motion transitions.
- **FIX (Example)**: Updated the example app's initialization config to enforce `MotionDetectionMode.accelerometer` as the default to ensure immediate indoor responsiveness upon installation.

## 2.0.8

- **FIX**(ios): Resolved type casting bug for 64-bit Pigeon `Int64` integer values across all iOS config mappings. Integer configurations (such as `stopTimeout`, `locationUpdateInterval`, etc.) are now correctly applied on iOS instead of silently falling back to defaults.
- **PERF**(ios): Added optimization to skip the GPS `distanceFilter` override to continuous tracking during `stopTimeout` when `preventSuspend` is enabled. This significantly reduces stationary battery drain when using the audio keep-alive feature.
- **CHORE**: Update platform-specific dependency constraints to `^2.0.8`.

## 2.0.7

- **FIX**: Corrected `intToAuthStatus` permission index mappings on Android and iOS — `getLocationAuthorization()` and `requestLocationAuthorization()` now return the correct `AuthorizationStatus` values ([#80](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/80)).
- **FIX**: Resolved Android SQLCipher migration crashes by loading the SQLCipher native library explicitly before migration and decoupling classpath availability checks to avoid class loading errors ([#78](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/78)).
- **FIX**: Prevented false positive shake events on Android by applying absolute values to motion sensor magnitude readings and fixed zero-timeout logic to immediately transition to stationary state when delay is zero or negative ([#79](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/79)).
- **FIX**: Removed manual Kotlin Gradle Plugin (KGP) configuration to support Flutter's new Built-in Kotlin feature, resolving build warnings and failures on newer Flutter versions ([#81](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/81)).
- **CHORE**: Update platform-specific dependency constraints to `^2.0.7`.

## 2.0.6

- **PERF**: Hardware-level sensor batching on Android reduces CPU wake-ups by over 90% during active accelerometer monitoring.
- **FIX**: iOS `BatteryBudgetEngine` adjustments (distance filter, desired accuracy, periodic interval) are now correctly applied to the location engine.
- **PERF**: iOS Heartbeat deduplication avoids redundant SQLite writes and HTTP sync attempts when stationary.
- **FIX**: Restored fast stationary detection (~5s dwell window) on iOS by correcting sample calculations to match 10Hz accelerometer rate.
- **FEAT**: Added graceful hardware fallback on Android to use `TYPE_SIGNIFICANT_MOTION` when the primary accelerometer is missing.
- **FEAT**: Added explicit permission checks and events upon start when location permissions are missing.
- **CHORE**: Update platform-specific dependency constraints to `^2.0.6`.

## 2.0.5

- **FEAT**: Added `Tracelet.isHeadlessRegistered` static getter. Returns `true` after `registerHeadlessTask()` has been called. Useful for diagnostic tools like `tracelet_doctor` to detect missing headless handlers.
- **CHORE**: New companion package `tracelet_doctor` (v1.0.0) — drop-in diagnostic overlay widget. See [tracelet_doctor](https://pub.dev/packages/tracelet_doctor).

## 2.0.4

- **FEAT**: Integrated Kalman Location Filter GPS smoothing into the Flutter plugin and the dynamic config settings in the Example App.
- **CHORE**: Update platform-specific dependency constraints to `^2.0.4`.

## 2.0.3

- **FIX**: Removed unreliable timestamp drift heuristic from Android and iOS location spoofing detection. This prevents valid locations from being incorrectly rejected when a device's wall-clock time is slightly out of sync with GPS UTC time.

## 2.0.1

- **FIX**: Fixed persistent blue location indicator on iOS by properly conditionally disabling `CLBackgroundActivitySession` and continuous GPS in low-accuracy geofence-only mode.
- **CHORE**: Bumped native SDK dependencies to `2.0.1`.

## 2.0.0

### 🎉 Major Milestone: Tracelet 2.0.0

Tracelet 2.0.0 introduces a modernized configuration schema, robust type-safe platform communication via Pigeon, and a flexible dependency model to optimize app size and compatibility.

### 🚨 Breaking Changes
- **Refactored Configuration**: The `Config` model is now a nested compound structure. Fields are grouped into `GeoConfig`, `AppConfig`, `AndroidConfig`, `HttpConfig`, `LoggerConfig`, `MotionConfig`, `GeofenceConfig`, and `SecurityConfig`.
- **Android On-Demand Dependencies**: Optional features (GMS Location, SQLCipher, Play Integrity) are no longer bundled by default, reducing APK size by ~16 MB. Developers must now explicitly add these to their `android/app/build.gradle` if required.
- **Pigeon Migration**: All platform-to-native communication now uses strictly-typed Pigeon interfaces, improving reliability and eliminating magic string/map errors.
- **Removed Deprecated APIs**: Permission methods that returned raw integers (e.g., `getPermissionStatus`, `requestPermission`) have been removed in favor of the strongly-typed `Future<AuthorizationStatus>` methods introduced in 1.9.0.

### 🛠️ Improvements
- **Motion Sensitivity Tuning**: Added `shakeThreshold`, `stillThreshold`, and `stillSampleCount` to `MotionConfig`, providing granular control over accelerometer-based motion detection across all platforms.
- **iOS Stability**: Resolved a critical issue where native permission dialogs failed to appear by enforcing main-thread execution for all `CoreLocation` and `CoreMotion` requests.
- **Cross-Platform Parity**: Aligned authorization status mapping across Android and iOS to ensure consistent behavior when checking permissions.
- **AOSP Support**: Improved fallback to standard `LocationManager` on Android when Google Play Services are unavailable.

## 1.9.3
2: 
3: - **CHORE**: Bump native SDK dependencies to `1.1.4`.
4: - **CHORE**: Aligned repository podspec files and updated release documentation.
5: 
6: ## 1.9.2

- **REFACTOR**: Migrated `TlTrackingMode` to a strongly-typed enum across the entire Pigeon bridge. This improves type safety and developer experience by eliminating magic integers in the platform communication layer. Android and iOS native implementations now use the generated enum types directly.
- **FIX**: Resolved "Unable to establish connection" regression in `locationStream` when secondary engines (like overlays or background isolates) detach. Ensured `destroyAll()` is correctly integrated into the `primaryInstance` guard on both Android and iOS to prevent resource leaks and duplicate registrations during hot restarts.
- **FIX**: `Tracelet.locationStream` no longer goes silent when `flutter_overlay_window` (or any plugin using `FlutterEngineGroup`) creates a secondary in-process `FlutterEngine`. The primary-instance guard introduced in 1.9.0 (#51) blocked `EventDispatcher` re-binding for in-process overlay engines, causing Pigeon FlutterApi `onLocation` channel to report "Unable to establish connection". A Looper-based discriminator now distinguishes overlay engines (main-thread attach → re-bind dispatcher) from headless background engines (off-thread attach → full skip, preserving #51).
- **FIX**: Android `destroyAll()` now guards all background-critical subsystems when `stopOnTerminate: false` (#65). `httpSyncManager.stop()`, `scheduleManager.stop()`, and `stopHeartbeat()` were still called unconditionally on every swipe-to-dismiss, permanently killing HTTP sync and heartbeat monitoring until the app was manually reopened. Fixed in native `tracelet-sdk` 1.1.2.
- **CHORE**: Aligned `PigeonTracelet` serialization logic to use enum indices for backward compatibility with the high-level `State` model while maintaining type-safe internal bridge contracts.

## 1.9.1

- **FIX**: Android `destroyAll()` now respects `stopOnTerminate: false` for continuous and geofence tracking modes (#63). `locationEngine.destroy()` was unconditionally called in `onDetachedFromEngine()`, racing with `LocationService.onTaskRemoved()` which bootstraps native tracking. Background location tracking now survives app swipe from recents when `stopOnTerminate: false` is configured.

## 1.9.0

- **FEAT**: Strongly typed permission APIs (#57). Added `getLocationAuthorization`, `requestLocationAuthorization`, `getNotificationAuthorization`, `requestNotificationAuthorization`, `getMotionAuthorization`, `requestMotionAuthorization`, and `requestTemporaryFullAccuracyAuthorization`, all returning `Future<AuthorizationStatus>` instead of magic ints. The matching int-returning methods (`getPermissionStatus`, `requestPermission`, `getNotificationPermissionStatus`, `requestNotificationPermission`, `getMotionPermissionStatus`, `requestMotionPermission`, `requestTemporaryFullAccuracy`) are now `@Deprecated` and will be removed in 2.0.0.
- **FIX**: Android `LocationService` no longer crashes the host app with `RemoteServiceException: Context.startForegroundService() did not then call Service.startForeground()` (#59). Reproducible on real devices when using `periodicUseForegroundService: true`. Root cause: `onStartCommand` only promoted to foreground for `ACTION_START`, but the system can deliver intents for other actions (and null-intent sticky restarts after a system kill) under the same foreground-service contract. Fixed in native `tracelet-sdk` 1.1.0 by always promoting at the top of `onStartCommand`.
- **FIX**: `Geofence(extras: {...})` now correctly persists and is returned by `getGeofences()` and delivered in `onGeofence` events (#58). Bug was in `tracelet_platform_interface`'s `_mapToGeofence`, which silently dropped `extras` and `vertices` when constructing the Pigeon payload; the 1.8.12 native fix had no effect because the data never crossed the platform channel. Affected both Android and iOS.
- **TEST**: Added on-device integration test (`example/integration_test/geofence_extras_test.dart`) that round-trips `addGeofence` → `getGeofences()` to prevent regression.

## 1.8.13

- **PERF**: Reduce first-fix latency on stationary → moving transitions on both iOS and Android. The native engines now fire an additional one-shot location request when motion starts, delivering a fresh GPS fix in ~1–5s instead of waiting for `distanceFilter` (iOS) or `locationUpdateInterval` (Android) on the continuous stream (#54).
- **FIX**: Android — after a manual `Tracelet.changePace(false)` (force stationary), the SDK can now detect real motion and resume tracking automatically. Previously the wake-up sensors stayed torn down, leaving the SDK in a dead-state. iOS was unaffected.
- **FIX**: Bump iOS native SDK to 1.0.11 and Android native SDK to 1.0.12.

## 1.8.12

- **FIX**: Geofence `extras` now arrive in `GeofenceEvent.extras` on Android (previously always empty). Location `extras` are also correctly included when reading back persisted locations (#51 follow-up).
- **FIX**: Bump Android native SDK to 1.0.11.

## 1.8.11

- **FIX**: Geofence callbacks no longer silently stop during continuous tracking when a secondary FlutterEngine (e.g. Firebase background messaging) registers the plugin (#51).

## 1.8.10

- **FIX**: Killed-state tracking now works reliably — `stopBootTracking()` deferred from `initialize()` to `ready()` so boot-mode native tracking survives until the Dart side explicitly takes over (#50).
- **FIX**: Bump native SDKs to 1.0.10.

## 1.8.9

## 1.8.7

- **FIX**: Enhance overall stability by including pending 1.8.6 patches.
- **FIX**: Bump native SDKs to 1.0.7.

## 1.8.6

- **FIX**: `getCurrentPosition(samples: 1)` now forces a fresh GPS fix instead of returning stale cached locations — uses `requestLocationUpdates`/`startUpdatingLocation` instead of `getCurrentLocation`/`requestLocation` which may return cached data without waking GPS hardware (#46).

- **FIX**: Update `tracelet_web` dependency to `^1.6.1` — fixes 5 missing HTTP Sync method stubs that caused `UnimplementedError` on web.

## 1.6.1

- **FEAT**: Add 401-aware retry — native HTTP sync now detects 401 responses, invokes the headless headers callback (`registerHeadlessHeadersCallback`) to refresh authorization tokens, and retries the request once with updated dynamic headers. Works in both foreground and killed-state (headless) modes.

## 1.6.0

- **FEAT**: Add SSL certificate pinning via `HttpConfig.sslPinningCertificates` and `HttpConfig.sslPinningFingerprints`.

- **PERF**: Add 22 new benchmarks covering DeltaEncoder, BatteryBudgetEngine, CarbonEstimator, PersistDecider, Config/State serialization.
- **PERF**: iOS `markSynced()` now uses chunked prepared statements (500 UUIDs/chunk) to avoid SQLite variable limit and improve sync performance.

## 1.3.0

- **FIX**: `getState()` always returned `enabled: false` on iOS — the iOS `StateManager.toMap()` flat-merged config keys into the state dictionary, overwriting `enabled` and `isMoving` with config defaults. Fixed by nesting config under a `"config"` key, matching Android behavior ([#26](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/26)).

## 1.2.0

### Breaking Changes

- **REFACTOR**: `ForegroundServiceConfig.notificationPriority` changed from `int` to `NotificationPriority` enum. Replace raw integers (`-2`..`2`) with enum values (`NotificationPriority.min`, `.low`, `.defaultPriority`, `.high`, `.max`).
- **REFACTOR**: `AuditConfig.hashAlgorithm` changed from `String` to `HashAlgorithm` enum. Replace `'SHA-256'` with `HashAlgorithm.sha256`, `'SHA-512'` with `HashAlgorithm.sha512`, etc.
- **REFACTOR**: `MotionConfig.triggerActivities` changed from comma-separated `String` to `Set<ActivityType>`. Replace `'on_foot, in_vehicle'` with `{ActivityType.onFoot, ActivityType.inVehicle}`.

### Notes

- Native platform channel serialization is backward-compatible — no native code changes required. `notificationPriority` still serializes as int, `hashAlgorithm` as `"SHA-256"` string, and `triggerActivities` as comma-separated string.

## 1.1.0

### New Features

- **FEAT**: Add `ComplianceReport` model and `Tracelet.generateComplianceReport()` API for GDPR Article 30 / CCPA data processing inventory reports. Auto-generates a structured snapshot of all location data collection metadata including: `totalLocationsStored`, `totalLocationsSynced`, data retention policy (`maxDaysToPersist`, `maxRecordsToPersist`), timestamp bounds of stored records (`oldestRecord`, `newestRecord`), database encryption status, active privacy zone count and identifiers, HTTP sync URL and auto-sync state, audit trail status with chain validation, permission states (location + motion), and tracking configuration flags (sparse updates, Kalman filter, delta compression, tracking mode). Supports `toJson()` for automated tooling integration and `toMarkdown()` for human-readable audit documents.
- **FEAT**: Add `BatteryBudgetEngine` algorithm — a feedback control loop that automatically adjusts `distanceFilter`, `desiredAccuracy`, and periodic interval to maintain a configurable battery budget. Set `batteryBudgetPerHour` in `GeoConfig` (typical range: 1.0–5.0 %/hr) to enable. Subscribe to `Tracelet.onBudgetAdjustment()` for real-time adjustment events showing current drain vs. target and the new parameters being applied.
- **FEAT**: Add `CarbonEstimator` — per-trip and cumulative CO₂ emission calculator using EU EEA 2024 mode-specific emission factors (gCO₂/km): car = 192, bus = 89, train = 41, walking/cycling = 0. Integrates with activity recognition to track distance per transport mode via Haversine. Returns `TripCarbonSummary` with `totalCarbonGrams`, `totalDistanceMeters`, `carbonByMode`, `distanceByMode`, and `dominantMode`. Tracks cumulative totals across trips.
- **FEAT**: Add `DeltaEncoder` algorithm — batch location compression codec using delta encoding with 60–80% payload reduction. First location transmitted in full; subsequent positions as deltas with shortened field names and configurable coordinate precision (5 = ~1.1 m, 6 = ~0.11 m). Native implementations provided on Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) for consistency.
- **FEAT**: Add `RTree<T>` spatial index — O(log n) geofence proximity queries supporting 10,000+ geofences with sub-millisecond lookup. Provides `queryCircle()` and `queryBBox()` APIs with Haversine-verified results.

### New Configuration Fields

- **FEAT**: `GeoConfig.batteryBudgetPerHour` (`double`, default `0.0`) — target max battery drain (%/hr). When > 0, enables `BatteryBudgetEngine` which auto-adjusts accuracy, distance filter, and sample rate. Overrides manual settings.
- **FEAT**: `GeoConfig.enableSparseUpdates` (`bool`, default `false`) — app-level deduplication that drops locations within `sparseDistanceThreshold` (default 50 m) of the last recorded position. Unlike `distanceFilter` (which controls platform GPS sampling), this filters at the persistence layer. `sparseMaxIdleSeconds` (default 300) forces periodic "still here" updates.
- **FEAT**: `GeoConfig.enableDeadReckoning` (`bool`, default `false`) — inertial navigation using accelerometer + gyroscope + compass when GPS is lost for longer than `deadReckoningActivationDelay` seconds (default 10). Auto-stops after `deadReckoningMaxDuration` seconds (default 120) to prevent IMU drift accumulation.
- **FEAT**: `HttpConfig.enableDeltaCompression` (`bool`, default `false`) — enable delta encoding for batch HTTP syncs. `deltaCoordinatePrecision` (default 6) controls coordinate precision.
- **FEAT**: `HttpConfig.disableAutoSyncOnCellular` (`bool`, default `false`) — skip auto-sync on cellular networks, only sync on WiFi. Supported on Android, iOS, and Web (via Network Information API).
- **FEAT**: `GeoConfig.enableAdaptiveMode` (`bool`, default `false`) — dynamic sampling based on activity type + battery level + charging state. Activity profiles: still → 500 m, walking → 50 m, driving → 10 m; battery scaling progressively widens filter below 50%/20%/10%.
- **FEAT**: Periodic mode configuration: `periodicLocationInterval` (60–43200 sec), `periodicDesiredAccuracy`, `periodicUseForegroundService` (Android — sub-15-min intervals), `periodicUseExactAlarms` (Android — `AlarmManager` precision).

### Bug Fixes

- **FIX**: `generateComplianceReport()` and `getHealthCheck()` no longer crash with `type 'Map<Object?, Object?>' is not a subtype of type 'Map<String, Object?>'` errors. Platform channel maps are now safely converted via `Map<String, Object?>.from()` instead of direct `as` casts. Also fixed nested config sub-map casts (`config`, `geo`, `http`, `audit`, `persistence`) using null-safe `is Map` checks.

### Infrastructure

- **CHORE**: Migrate melos configuration from standalone `melos.yaml` to `pubspec.yaml` under the `melos:` key for melos 7.x compatibility. All 13 scripts (analyze, format, format:fix, test, test:dart, pigeon, clean, pub:get, build:example:android/ios/web, coverage, benchmark) now run via `melos run <name>`.
- **CHORE**: Adopt Dart pub workspaces — root `pubspec.yaml` declares `workspace:` listing all 6 packages; each package declares `resolution: workspace`. Removed 5 `pubspec_overrides.yaml` files that are no longer needed.
- **CHORE**: Upgrade melos dependency from `^6.0.0` to `^7.0.0`.

## 1.0.2

- **FIX**: (Android/iOS) Geofence registrations were unconditionally destroyed on app termination and reset, even when `stopOnTerminate: false` was configured with `trackingMode=1`. Geofences now survive process death and are properly re-registered ([#23](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/23)).

## 1.0.1

- **FIX**: HTTP auto-sync was not triggered during automatic location tracking on any platform — locations accumulated in the database without being synced to the server ([#21](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/21)).
- **FIX**: (iOS) `HttpMethod.put` was silently ignored due to type mismatch in native config parsing.
- **FIX**: (iOS) HTTP headers could be dropped when platform channel delivered mixed-type maps.
- **FIX**: (iOS) `maxBatchSize` default corrected from 100 to 250.

- **PERF**: Use `Map.from()` instead of `.map()` with `MapEntry` for extras in `Location.fromMap()` (D-L4).
- **REFACTOR**: Deduplicate `LocationProcessor` parameter list in `setConfig()` (D-L5).

## 0.11.5

- **FIX**: [Android/iOS] Polygon geofence `vertices` are now correctly persisted to the native SQLite databases. Previously, vertex data was silently dropped during `addGeofence()`, causing polygon geofences to revert to circular after app restart.

## 0.11.4

- **FIX**: [iOS] Revert over-aggressive permission guards — When In Use permission now works correctly for all tracking modes. Only the killed-state auto-resume (`autoResumeTracking`) requires Always authorization. iOS enforces permission at the OS level.

## 0.11.3

- **FIX**: [Android] Enforce `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` check on all killed-state restart paths (boot receiver, task removal, periodic alarms/workers). "While In Use" permission no longer triggers background tracking.
- **FIX**: [iOS] Enforce `.authorizedAlways` check on killed-state auto-resume and guard `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates`. "When In Use" permission no longer triggers tracking from killed state.- **FEAT**: Add `Tracelet.hasBackgroundPermission` static getter — convenience check that returns `true` when location permission is `AuthorizationStatus.always`.
## 0.11.2

- **DOCS**: Fix 22 unresolved dartdoc references (`[Enterprise]`, `[Config.*]`, `[isValid]`, `[brokenAtIndex]`, `[brokenAtUuid]`).

## 0.11.1

- **FEAT**: Add `canScheduleExactAlarms()` and `openExactAlarmSettings()` static methods for Android exact alarm permission management.
- **FIX**: Bypass `LocationProcessor` distance/accuracy/speed filters for periodic location events — every timed fix is now delivered regardless of movement.
- **CHORE**: Bump platform interface to 0.11.1.

## 0.11.0

- **FEAT**: Tamper-proof audit trail — SHA-256 hash chain for location integrity verification.
- **FEAT**: Privacy zones — exclude, degrade, or event-only actions for geographic privacy control.

- **DOCS**: Added AUDIT-TRAIL.md and PRIVACY-ZONES.md guides.
- **CHORE**: Bump all platform packages to ^0.11.0.

## 0.10.0

- **FEAT**: Periodic mode — `Tracelet.startPeriodic()` for GPS-friendly interval tracking. GPS icon visible only ~5–10 seconds per fix instead of permanently.
- **FEAT**: `GeoConfig` periodic options: `periodicLocationInterval`, `periodicDesiredAccuracy`, `periodicUseForegroundService`, `periodicUseExactAlarms`.
- **FEAT**: Three Android scheduling strategies: WorkManager (default, battery-optimal), foreground service (reliable timing), and AlarmManager exact alarms (precise, no notification).
- **FEAT**: Example app: periodic mode UI section with start/stop toggle, custom settings dialog, and map integration with distinct cyan markers.
- **DOCS**: Updated API.md, CONFIGURATION.md, BACKGROUND-TRACKING.md, and INSTALL-ANDROID.md with periodic mode and exact alarms documentation.
- **CHORE**: Bump all platform packages to ^0.10.0.

## 0.9.1

- **FIX**: iOS `HttpSyncManager` optional `UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier` unwrap safety.

## 0.9.0
