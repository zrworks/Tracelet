/// **Enterprise** — Tamper-proof location audit trail configuration.
///
/// When enabled, every persisted location record is hashed with SHA-256
/// and chained to the previous record's hash — creating a blockchain-like
/// chain of custody that cryptographically proves no records were inserted,
/// deleted, or modified.
///
/// ## How It Works
///
/// 1. Each location record produces a **canonical string** from its key
///    fields (lat, lng, timestamp, accuracy, speed, heading, altitude,
///    odometer, uuid, isMoving).
/// 2. The canonical string is prepended with the **previous record's hash**
///    and fed into SHA-256.
/// 3. The resulting hash is stored alongside the location in the database.
/// 4. The first record in the chain uses a **genesis hash** derived from
///    a device-specific identifier.
///
/// ## Verification
///
/// Call [Tracelet.verifyAuditTrail()] to walk the entire chain and verify
/// every link. If any record has been inserted, deleted, or modified, the
/// chain breaks at the tampered record.
///
/// ## Use Cases
///
/// - **Delivery proof**: Prove a driver was at a location at a specific time.
/// - **Employee tracking compliance**: Tamper-proof attendance trails.
/// - **Insurance claims**: Verifiable location evidence.
/// - **Regulatory audits**: Chain-of-custody for HIPAA, SOX, GDPR.
/// - **Legal evidence**: Cryptographic proof of data integrity.
///
/// ## HTTP Sync
///
/// When audit trail is enabled, HTTP sync payloads automatically include
/// `audit_hash`, `audit_previous_hash`, and `audit_chain_index` fields,
/// enabling server-side verification.
///
/// ```dart
/// Config(
///   audit: AuditConfig(
///     enabled: true,
///     hashAlgorithm: 'SHA-256', // only SHA-256 supported currently
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
