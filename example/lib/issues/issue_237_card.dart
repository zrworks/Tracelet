/// Issue #237 — periodic mode with `periodicUseForegroundService: true` did not
/// start a foreground service, so tracking died the moment the app was swiped
/// away (only reproducible for sub-15-min intervals, the foreground-service
/// strategy).
///
/// Root cause: `startPeriodic()` tore the foreground service down up-front
/// (ACTION_STOP) and immediately restarted it (ACTION_START) in the same call.
/// On a fresh start the ACTION_STOP handler's `stopSelf()` raced the pending
/// ACTION_START and could win, destroying the service right after it was
/// promoted — leaving no foreground service at all. Continuous mode never
/// pre-stops, which is why it was unaffected.
///
/// This test starts the exact reporter configuration (periodic + foreground
/// service, 60s interval) and verifies tracking is enabled in periodic mode.
/// Foreground service is Android-only, so it is skipped on other platforms.
/// Confirm on-device that the service now survives with:
///
///   adb shell dumpsys activity services <your.package.name>
