# tracelet_platform_interface

A common platform interface for the [Tracelet](https://pub.dev/packages/tracelet) background geolocation plugin.

This package provides the abstract classes and types that the platform-specific implementations (`tracelet_android`, `tracelet_ios`, `tracelet_web`) implement.

It also contains shared Dart algorithms used by all platforms: `LocationProcessor` (distance/accuracy/speed/mock filtering), `KalmanLocationFilter` (GPS smoothing), `AdaptiveSamplingEngine` (activity/battery/speed-based distance filter), `GeofenceEvaluator`, `TripManager`, `ScheduleParser`, `PersistDecider`, and `GeoUtils`. See `MockDetectionLevel` enum and `LocationProcessor` mock detection for cross-platform spoof rejection.

The OEM Compatibility API (`getSettingsHealth()`, `openOemSettings()`) is defined here as abstract methods, with platform implementations providing manufacturer-specific behavior.

## Usage

**You should not depend on this package directly.** Instead, depend on [`tracelet`](https://pub.dev/packages/tracelet) which automatically includes the correct platform implementation.

This package is only relevant if you are writing a custom platform implementation for Tracelet.
