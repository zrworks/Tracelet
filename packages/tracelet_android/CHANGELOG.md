## 3.5.2

**FIX**: Android continuous tracking no longer silently stops after a while on aggressive OEMs (Samsung One UI, etc.). The foreground-service wakelock used a fixed 10-minute auto-expiry and was never renewed, so once it lapsed the CPU could deep-sleep and FusedLocationProvider stopped delivering updates with no error or callback. The wakelock is now renewed for the lifetime of tracking ([#222](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/222)).

## 3.5.1

**FEAT**: Crash detection now uses the device barometer as an extra confirmation clue — a serious crash or airbag deployment causes a quick cabin air-pressure change, which raises crash confidence on phones that have a pressure sensor. Phones without one simply skip this check, with no downside ([#173](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/173)).
**FEAT**: Crashes are now corroborated by a sudden post-impact speed collapse — when the vehicle goes from fast to nearly stopped in the seconds right after the jolt, crash confidence is raised. It only ever adds confidence, never cancels a real crash ([#181](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/181)).
**FEAT**: Falls are now corroborated by the classic free-fall → impact → stillness signature — a brief weightless drop followed by the body coming to rest raises fall confidence ([#180](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/180)).
**FEAT**: Crash/fall confirmation is now process-death-safe — if the OS kills the app during the cancel countdown (phone thrown, vehicle at rest, Doze), the confirmed event is still delivered from a re-armed exact `AlarmManager` wake-up ([#182](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/182)).
**DOCS**: Rewrote the Driving & Safety crash/fall confirmation section in plain, beginner-friendly language.

## 3.5.0

**FEAT**: Crash-detection ML model promoted from **beta to stable** — the shipped model is trained on the CC0 / public-domain Smartphone IMU Road Accident Detection dataset, so it is cleared for commercial use in production apps ([#183](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/183)).
**FEAT**: The on-device encrypted model cache now auto-re-downloads when a new model version is published (SHA-256 of the cached blob no longer matches the expected digest), so model upgrades roll out in the same session instead of falling back to the rule engine for a cycle.
**FEAT** (example): Driving & Safety page now shows a live crash-model download/load status indicator, a "Crash (ML model)" debug inference path, a "Benign bump" demo, and a bench "Throw-test" mode.
**PERF**: Per-window crash-model probability is now logged for on-device observability.

## 3.4.2

 - **FEAT**: implement telematics deduplication with synced-state tracking and improved foreground service fault tolerance. ([0581c6e7](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/0581c6e7a30a5d436ceb2e8c5d75e46505431e4b))

## 3.4.1

 - **FEAT**(geofence): cross-platform geofenceModeHighAccuracy via GeofenceConfig. ([491d5b83](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/491d5b836fbd98a2e456d7d07bafc500f95a2fac))

## 3.4.0

 - **FIX**: a single location batch is uploaded exactly once — replacing/cancelling a previously-registered sync provider prevents duplicate `requestSyncBody` calls and duplicate uploads/DB rows ([#204](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/204)).
 - **FIX**: `getCurrentPosition` floors passive priority to balanced so an explicit one-shot always obtains a fix instead of failing with `LOCATION_FAILURE`; per-call extras merge with global extras ([#201](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/201)).
 - **REFACTOR**: extract issues 185 and 198, fix iOS config mapping. ([1d088e0d](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/1d088e0d58e863b11217c5040410381f91930e59))

## 3.3.4

**FIX**: resolve battery and extras DB persistence (#175)

## 3.3.3

 - **FIX**(android): deliver headless geofence events after reboot in high-accuracy mode ([#185](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/185)). ([b197dc5f](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/b197dc5f0e4b5f081590e806b27a6eb52a4ed253))

## 3.3.2

* **FIX** (Location data, Android/iOS): Several location-map fields surfaced as static/default values in the Dart layer because the native-map → platform-channel converters dropped or mis-keyed them ([#175](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/175)):
  * `getCurrentPosition(extras:, desiredAccuracy:)` were silently ignored on Android (never forwarded to the SDK) — now applied.
  * `battery.isCharging` was always `false` — the converter read `isCharging` instead of the native snake_case `is_charging`.
  * `isMoving` was always `false` — read `isMoving` instead of native `is_moving`.

  Converters now read the native keys (with camelCase fallback), and field-by-field regression tests over the converters were added on both platforms to prevent recurrence.
* **TUNE** (Crash detection): Lowered the default `crashGThreshold` from `3.0 g` to `2.0 g`. Validation against the large [VZCrash](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vzc-research-chapter/VZCrash) field dataset showed the 3.0 g speed-gated rule missed ~48% of real crashes (median impact ~2.2 g) while the false-positive budget was small. Crash detection is opt-in with a cancel-countdown, so the default now favours recall — raise it if you see too many prompts. See [#173](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/173). *(Crash detection remains beta pending first-party field validation.)*

## 3.3.1

 - **REFACTOR**(logging): route all SDK logs through TraceletLogger (no raw Log/NSLog). ([e42b676a](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/e42b676ae63581d80cee4ac6e35c6103cf7dd0f6))

## 3.3.0

* **FEAT** (Battery, Android): Motion-gated wakelock — drop the OEM partial wakelock when stationary and re-assert it on movement, via `AndroidConfig.releaseWakelockWhenStationary` (opt-in, default off; gated on the hardware significant-motion wake sensor) ([#162](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/162)).
* **FEAT** (Driving & Safety): On-device driving-behavior telematics — `harsh_braking` / `harsh_acceleration` / `harsh_cornering` / `speeding` via `TelematicsConfig` + `Tracelet.onDrivingEvent` (opt-in, default off) ([#163](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/163)).
* **FEAT** (Driving & Safety): On-device transport-mode classifier (still/walking/running/cycling/vehicle) fusing accelerometer + GPS via `ClassifierConfig` + `Tracelet.onModeChange` ([#164](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/164)).
* **FEAT** (Driving & Safety): Crash & fall detection with a cancel-countdown confirmation flow via `ImpactConfig` + `Tracelet.onImpact` and `Tracelet.confirmImpact` / `Tracelet.cancelImpact` (opt-in, default off) ([#165](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/165)).
* All three features are **default-off** and side-channel — no change to existing tracking when disabled. See [Driving & Safety](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/blob/main/help/DRIVING-AND-SAFETY.md).

## 3.2.19

**CHORE**: version bump for patch release

## 3.2.18

* **FIX** (Native): `ready()` / `getState()` now populate `State.config` with the active configuration instead of leaving it permanently `null` ([#147](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/147)).
* **FEAT**: Add `HttpConfig.syncInterval` for interval-based sync — the documented repeating-timer cadence was missing from the Dart config and the Pigeon layer; the native interval timer now flushes the offline queue on this cadence ([#149](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/149)).
* **FIX** (Native): `destroySyncedLocations()` returns the real number of synced-and-pruned locations instead of a hardcoded `0` stub ([#154](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/154)).
* **FEAT**: Expose the offline queue with `getPendingLocations()` and `getPendingLocationCount()` ([#159](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/159)).
* **FIX** (Native): Honor the `useKalmanFilter` config key so the Extended Kalman Filter is no longer silently disabled by a key mismatch ([#148](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/148)).
* **FIX** (Native): Propagate the detected activity (walking / driving / still) into recorded locations — fixes a permanent `"activity": "unknown"` ([#155](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/155)).
* **FIX** (Native): Rebuild the native location processor when `ready()` applies a new config, so settings such as `distanceFilter` take effect immediately instead of using stale defaults ([#157](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/157)).
* **FIX** (Native): `getCount()` honors time-bound queries instead of always returning the whole-database total ([#152](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/152)).
* **FIX**: Guard the `AuditConfig` hash-algorithm mapping so configuring `sha384` / `sha512` no longer crashes with a fatal `RangeError` during `ready()` — unsupported variants fall back to `sha256` ([#150](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/150)).
* **FIX** (Native): The HTTP sync payload now includes each point's motion state `is_moving` ([#151](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/151)) and its trigger `event` (location / motionchange / heartbeat / geofence) ([#156](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/156)) — both were previously omitted by the native sync record.

## 3.2.17

* **FIX** (Native): Resolve iOS auto-sync thread starvation by offloading synchronous HTTP requests to a background DispatchQueue to prevent blocking Swift Concurrency pools ([#146](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/146)).
* **CHORE** (Docs): Fix Nextra changelog rendering bug and improve auto-translation glossary script for internationalization.

## 3.2.16

* **FIX** (Native): Resolve Android/iOS getting stuck in the moving state and never transitioning back to stationary, which kept continuous GPS active and drained the battery. The accelerometer stillness sampler now stays active during the stop-timeout countdown and requires sustained motion — rather than a single noisy or stale sample — to abort it ([#142](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/142)).
* **FIX** (Native): Background and post-reboot location captures are persisted (and therefore synced) again. Headless tracking (killed-state relaunch / boot) never calls `ready()`, so an internal readiness guard silently dropped every captured location before it reached the database, leaving auto-sync with nothing to upload.
* **FIX** (Android): The foreground-service notification now reliably appears when the app is backgrounded or terminated with `showNotificationOnPauseOnly` enabled. The app's own foreground service skewed foreground/background detection (and OS process-importance updates lag), so the pause-only notification was suppressed even though tracking and syncing continued.

## 3.2.15

* **FIX** (Native): Allow `getState()` and `stop()` to be called before `ready()` is invoked, correctly reporting persistent state and shutting down background services if the app was restarted from a killed state.
* **CHORE**: Update dependencies and constraints.
* **FIX**: Resolve `MissingPluginException` and test timing issues with `setHasCustomSyncBodyBuilder`.

## 3.2.14

 - **FIX**(sync): fix background auto-sync abortion when no custom builder is registered (Issue [#134](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/134)). ([631542a1](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/631542a1c89cece565160966c6f6301a0e18098a))
 - **FIX**(android): prevent headless engine from overwriting sync interceptor (Issue 136). ([b166bcd5](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/b166bcd56ad171e488b8c9aed9dda63ef2cc58bd))
 - **FIX**(android): align deltaCoordinatePrecision default with Dart (Issue [#137](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/137)). ([5edb9910](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/5edb99108eedd7e9dbbcb2a311af6729def6ff79))
 - **DOCS**(android): document Issue 136 fix to prevent regression. ([36b4b9c9](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/36b4b9c94f81ee8b852ce2cfcd8d368dd7cabba6))
 - **DOCS**: add official documentation URL to all package READMEs. ([9eb6951e](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/9eb6951e64c13007f3264e2d44f0feb9222500a3))
 - **DOCS**: integrate nextra website and update pubspec URLs. ([99b7fda8](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/99b7fda82e290ca6c8175313eae62a2475360050))

## 3.2.13

- **FIX**(android): `startOnBoot` now resumes tracking after a reboot even when the OS refuses to start the location foreground service from `BOOT_COMPLETED` (Android 14 disallows starting a `location`-type foreground service from boot). Previously the boot start was deferred until the app was next opened, so tracking silently never resumed after a reboot — `BootReceiver` now falls back to background WorkManager/alarm tracking when the foreground-service start is blocked.
- **FIX**(android): HTTP sync now works headlessly after a reboot. A new process-start `ContentProvider` wires the headless Dart bridge (`TraceletSdk.dartSyncInterceptor` + `TraceletBootstrap.headlessDispatcherFactory`) so background sync can refresh the auth token and build a custom sync body via the registered headless callbacks — previously these were only wired when a UI Flutter engine attached, so after a reboot sync POSTed with a stale token (or the wrong payload) until the app was opened.

## 3.2.12

- **CHORE**: Re-release to align the full federated package set and native SDKs to a single consistent version. The 3.2.11 release published with mismatched versions across some packages (a few resolved to 3.2.10). No functional code changes.

## 3.2.11

- **FIX**(android): Fall back to the headless engine when a custom sync-body round-trip times out, instead of aborting the sync. Fixes location sync stopping after a few minutes while the app is backgrounded (Issue #134).

## 3.2.10

 - **FIX**: ensure geofence action (ENTER/EXIT/DWELL) is correctly parsed from nested payloads on all platforms and update CI to scan dynamic frameworks for symbols.

## 3.2.9

- **FIX**(ios): Remove `TraceletCore+Dummy.swift` / `TraceletSyncFFI+Dummy.swift` — `@_silgen_name` declarations from the old static library model caused "Undefined symbol" linker errors after the static→dynamic xcframework migration.
- **FIX**(android): Catch `ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException` in `LocationService.start()` so calling `ready()` from the background on Android 12+ no longer crashes the host app; the foreground service start is deferred until the app returns to foreground.


## 3.2.8

- **FIX**: Persist geofence ENTER/EXIT events in offline queue and auto-sync to server — events were previously dispatched to the app but never stored in the local SQLite database (Issue #128).
- **FIX**: Structured event envelope (`event_type`, `event_payload`) for geofence events round-trips correctly through `getLocations()` and `insertLocation()`.
- **FIX**(sync): Stop POSTing malformed error payloads on failed HTTP sync requests; fix iOS custom-body deadlock in `setSyncBodyBuilder` (Issue #125).
- **FIX**(android): Throw `NOT_READY` error before `ready()` is called to match iOS parity; previously Android silently ignored SDK calls before initialization (Issue #129).
- **FIX**(ios): Resolve `flutter_rust_bridge has not been initialized` on release builds — `TraceletCore` is now a dynamic framework, preventing dead-code stripping of FRB symbols (Issues #116, #123, #124).
- **FIX**(android): Resolve `Failed to lookup symbol 'frb_get_rust_content_hash'` — Rust symbols are now loaded directly from `libtracelet_core.so` bypassing `RTLD_LOCAL` isolation (Issues #116, #123).
- **PERF**(ios): Reduce background motion sensor CPU/battery usage — accelerometer polling is now paused when stationary (Issue #130).
- **FIX**: Persist historical `is_moving` state per location record so `getLocations()` returns accurate values instead of always returning the current live state (Issue #126).

## 3.2.7

- **FIX**(ios): prevent dead code stripping of flutter_rust_bridge symbols in release builds.
- **FIX**(android): implement OEM hardening mitigations and introduce `showPowerManager` to handle aggressive battery restrictions on specific OEM devices.

## 3.2.6

- **PERF**: Optimize database timestamp queries for O(log N) fast filtering and resolve precision bugs (Issue #119).
- **FEAT**: Implement `sslPinningFingerprints` natively across iOS and Android with Rust configs.
- **FIX**: Include pinned fingerprints in SSL verification error logs and messages.
- **FIX**: Rate limit Android MotionDetector logcat flooding during stillness (Issue #121).
- **FIX**: Resolve race conditions in tests for Issue 118.
- **REFACTOR**: Update integration test to use Config.fromMap for comprehensive Tracelet configuration testing.

## 3.2.5
- **FIX**: Resolved iOS accelerometer sensitivity mismatch (stationary lock) by normalizing incoming m/s² thresholds to g-force expected by CMMotionManager.
- **FIX**: Unify motion detection initial state and resume behavior across Android and iOS, preventing incorrect forced states on app launch and correctly resuming saved states.
- **FIX**: Resolved `flutter_rust_bridge` dynamic library load failures on release builds for users without `use_frameworks!` by preserving global symbols during Xcode stripping.

## 3.2.4

* **FIX**(ios): safely resolve dynamic symbols when `use_frameworks! :linkage => :dynamic` is used.

## 3.2.3

- **FIX**: Force speed motion manager to evaluate initial speed on Android to prevent the state machine from being permanently stuck in `MOVING` when indoors ([#115](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/115)).
- **FIX**: Resolve `flutter_rust_bridge has not been initialized` crash by ensuring the Rust core is instantiated and initialized before accessing methods ([#116](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/116)).
- **CHORE**: Sync release versions across all packages.

## 3.2.2

- **CHORE**: Sync release versions across all federated packages and update Swift Package Manager configuration.

## 3.2.1

- **CHORE**: Align federated package versions and include additional patch updates.

## 3.2.0

- **FEAT**(android): Add reverse geocoding functionality.

- **FIX**(android): bump Android SDK and tracelet_android build.gradle versions to 3.1.14


## 3.1.10

 - Bump "tracelet_android" to `3.1.10`.

## 3.1.9

- **FIX**(android): conditionally apply kotlin-android plugin to support older flutter SDKs while preventing warnings in modern Flutter environments.
- **CHORE**(ci): add strict pre-publish flutter build verification step to `release.yml`.

## 3.1.8

- Fix iOS SPM publishing

## 3.1.7

 - **FIX**(android): apply kotlin-android plugin to fix gradle build errors on newer AGP versions.
 - **FIX**(ios): fix SPM source folder paths in release bundling to ensure SDK compiles properly via CocoaPods.
 - **FIX**(ios): fix duplicate module import errors by adding conditional import checks for TraceletSDK.

## 3.1.4

- **CHORE**: Sync release versions across workspace.

## 3.0.1

- **FIX**(ios): Add missing `FlutterFramework` dependency to SPM plugin configuration to resolve compilation failures and `PlatformException`s.

## 3.0.0

- **FEAT**: Massive Architecture Rewrite — Core algorithms are now powered by a high-performance **Rust Core** using `flutter_rust_bridge`.
- **FEAT**: Smart Motion Mode — Introduced `MotionDetectionMode.smart` powered by the Rust battery budget engine.
- **FEAT**: Migrated all platform event channels to use strongly-typed Pigeon bridges.

## 2.1.0

 - **FIX**: resolve background tracking loops, location stream drops, and permission issues. ([8abc7d41](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/8abc7d415b742a1aee7da50e16763babd83f9e53))
 - **FIX**: refactor string comparisons to enum indexing across all layers. ([b591b246](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/b591b246cca9d46a4fda32634e4b01d7c774ed05))
 - **FIX**: refactor speed motion strings to typed enums across Flutter, Pigeon, Android, and iOS SDKs. ([e974b728](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/e974b728142eb7b31b887a3b795cd527da6cbae1))
 - **FEAT**(android): smart foreground notification visibility. ([fbf46b27](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/fbf46b27d401828e1c79fd1853.1.4046aaf3f72))
 - **FEAT**: Speed-Based Motion Detection ([#83](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/83)). ([5421e7a0](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/5421e7a0974033ede6ee5234c641d9bb68cd4460))

## 2.0.8

 - **CHORE**: Update `tracelet_platform_interface` constraint to `^2.0.8`.
 - **CHORE**: Version bump for monorepo consistency and package lockstep alignment.

## 2.0.7

 - **FIX**(interface): correct intToAuthStatus permission index mappings ([[#80](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/80)](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/80)). ([8cfd7f51](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/8cfd7f5150791063bc1286c5c185d01f1d3fc306))
 - **FIX**(android): resolve SQLCipher migration crashes by explicitly loading the sqlcipher native library and decoupling the classpath availability check ([[#78](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/78)](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/78)). ([757147ee](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/757147eeacae07866aa04989a24ca9937307ff2f))
 - **FIX**(android): prevent false positive shake events using absolute sensor magnitude, and declare stationary state immediately when timeout is zero or negative ([[#79](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/79)](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/79)). ([2aac0a17](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/commit/2aac0a179c04debf816ed682f581666cd62006e7))
 - **FIX**(android): removed manual Kotlin Gradle Plugin (KGP) configuration to support Flutter's new Built-in Kotlin feature ([[#81](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/81)](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/81)).
 - **CHORE**: Update `tracelet_platform_interface` constraint to `^2.0.7`.

## 2.0.6

- **CHORE**: Update `tracelet_platform_interface` constraint to `^2.0.6`.
- **CHORE**: Bump native plugin implementation version to `2.0.6`.

## 2.0.5

- **CHORE**: Version bump for monorepo consistency and package lockstep alignment.
- **CHORE**: Update `tracelet_platform_interface` constraint to `^2.0.5`.
- **CHORE**: Bump native plugin implementation version to `2.0.5`.

## 2.0.4

- **CHORE**: Version bump for monorepo consistency and native SDK alignment.
- **CHORE**: Update `tracelet_platform_interface` constraint to `^2.0.4`.

## 2.0.3

- **FIX**: Removed unreliable timestamp drift heuristic from location spoofing detection.

## 2.0.1

- **CHORE**: Version bump for iOS status bar fix consistency.
- **CHORE**: Update `tracelet_platform_interface` constraint to `^2.0.1`.

## 2.0.0

- **BREAKING**: Adopts an "on-demand" dependency model. Core SDK no longer bundles GMS Location, SQLCipher, or Play Integrity by default, reducing APK size by ~16 MB. Developers must now explicitly add these to their `android/app/build.gradle` if required.
- **BREAKING**: Migrated to Pigeon for all platform-to-native communication, replacing `MethodChannel` with type-safe generated interfaces.
- **FEAT**: Full support for AOSP-only environments via standard `LocationManager` fallback when GMS is unavailable.
- **CHORE**: Bump native `tracelet-sdk` constraint to `2.0.0`.

## 1.9.3
2: 
3: - **CHORE**: Bump native `tracelet-sdk` constraint to `1.1.4`.
4: 
5: ## 1.9.2

- **FIX**: `Tracelet.locationStream` no longer goes silent when `flutter_overlay_window` (or any `FlutterEngineGroup` plugin) creates a secondary in-process `FlutterEngine`. The primary-instance guard (#51) unconditionally skipped `EventDispatcher` re-binding for all secondary engines, including in-process overlay engines that attach on the main thread. A Looper-based discriminator now selectively re-binds the dispatcher for main-thread overlay engines while preserving the full skip for off-thread headless/Firebase engines (#51 fix intact).
- **FIX**: `destroyAll()` now guards all background-critical subsystems when `stopOnTerminate: false` (#65). `httpSyncManager.stop()`, `scheduleManager.stop()`, and `stopHeartbeat()` were still called unconditionally on every swipe-to-dismiss, killing HTTP sync and heartbeat even when background tracking should survive. Fixed in native `tracelet-sdk` 1.1.2.
- **TEST**: Added `secondaryMainThreadEngine_rebindsDispatcherOnly` and `secondaryBackgroundThreadEngine_fullySkipped` to `PluginSecondaryEngineGuardTest` covering both discriminator branches. Existing headless tests updated to stub `isMainThread=false`.
- **CHORE**: Bump native `tracelet-sdk` constraint to 1.1.2.

## 1.9.1

- **FIX**: `destroyAll()` now respects `stopOnTerminate: false` for continuous (mode 0) and geofence (mode 1) tracking modes (#63). `locationEngine.destroy()` was unconditionally called, racing with `LocationService.onTaskRemoved()` native bootstrap. `PeriodicLocationWorker` static refs (`eventSender`, `httpSyncManager`) are also now preserved when `keepPeriodicAlive` is true.
- **CHORE**: Bump native `tracelet-sdk` constraint to 1.1.1.

## 1.9.0

- **FIX**: `LocationService` no longer crashes the host app with `RemoteServiceException: Context.startForegroundService() did not then call Service.startForeground()` (#59). Reproducible on real devices when using `periodicUseForegroundService: true`. Root cause: `onStartCommand` only promoted to foreground for `ACTION_START`, but the system can deliver intents for other actions (and null-intent sticky restarts after a system kill) under the same foreground-service contract. Fixed in native `tracelet-sdk` 1.1.0 by always promoting at the top of `onStartCommand`.
- **FIX**: Picks up the `tracelet_platform_interface` 1.9.0 fix that restores `extras` and `vertices` propagation for `addGeofence` (#58). No native-side changes for this part.
- **CHORE**: Bump native `tracelet-sdk` constraint to 1.1.0.
- **TEST**: Added Robolectric `LocationServiceForegroundContractTest` covering all 5 entry paths (ACTION_START, ACTION_STOP, ACTION_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION, ACTION_BUTTON, null-intent sticky restart).
- **TEST**: Added Robolectric regression test for `EventDispatcher` headless-fallback geofence extras forwarding.

## 1.8.13

- **PERF**: Reduce first-fix latency on stationary → moving transitions. `LocationEngine.changePace(true)` now fires an additional one-shot `getCurrentLocation()` so a fresh GPS fix arrives as soon as the hardware is warm, instead of waiting for `locationUpdateInterval` on the continuous stream. The one-shot is guarded by a `CancellationTokenSource` that is cancelled on `stop()` (#54).
- **FIX**: After a manual `Tracelet.changePace(false)`, MotionDetector’s accelerometer + significant-motion listeners are now re-engaged so real motion can resume tracking. Previously the SDK could get stuck in a permanent stationary state with no sensors listening.
- **FIX**: Bump Android native SDK to 1.0.12.

## 1.8.12

- **FIX**: Geofence `extras` are now delivered correctly to `onGeofence` callbacks. Previously, extras were persisted via `Map.toString()` and could not be parsed back into a Map, causing `GeofenceEvent.extras` to always arrive empty (#51 follow-up).
- **FIX**: Location `extras` are now included in read-back location maps (previously silently dropped in `cursorToLocation`).
- **FIX**: Bump Android native SDK to 1.0.11.

## 1.8.11

- **FIX**: Guard against secondary FlutterEngine (e.g. Firebase background messaging) overwriting SDK singleton's event sender and callbacks (#51).

## 1.8.10

- **FIX**: Killed-state tracking now works reliably — `stopBootTracking()` deferred from `sdk.initialize()` to `sdk.ready()` so boot-mode native tracking (LocationEngine + HttpSyncManager) survives until the Dart side explicitly takes over (#50).

- **FIX**: Guard `onAttachedToEngine` callback wiring with `primaryInstance` — prevents headless `FlutterEngine` from overwriting foreground `httpSyncManager` callbacks, which caused `requestFreshHeaders` to timeout (10s) or return `notImplemented`.
- **PERF**: Remove per-batch `onRequestFreshHeaders` invocation — eliminates MethodChannel round-trip before every sync request. Token refresh handled by `onAuthorizationRequired` on 401.
- **FIX**: Bump native SDK dependency to exact version `1.0.6`.
- **FIX**: Privacy zones, audit trail, and encryption APIs now work before `ready()` — guards relaxed from `isReady` to `::manager.isInitialized`.

## 1.8.5

- **FIX**: Use `LocationManagerCompat.isLocationEnabled()` instead of `LocationManager.isLocationEnabled()` — fixes crash on Android API 26/27.
- **FIX**: Enterprise dependencies (SQLCipher, Play Integrity, security-crypto) now degrade gracefully when absent — runtime `Class.forName` checks prevent `NoClassDefFoundError`.
- **FIX**: `DeviceAttestor` uses lazy `IntegrityManagerFactory` initialization — prevents crash when Play Integrity is not on the classpath.
- **REFACTOR**: Refined ProGuard/R8 consumer rules — narrower keep rules, `-dontwarn` for optional deps.
- **TEST**: Add `destroyAll_doesNotCrash_withoutSoundManager` unit test.

## 1.8.1

## 1.1.0

### New Features

- **FEAT**: Add native `DeltaEncoder` (Kotlin) for delta-compressed HTTP sync payloads — mirrors the Dart implementation exactly for platform consistency. Encodes only field deltas between consecutive locations using shortened keys (`la`, `lo`, `t`, `s`, `h`, `a`, `al`, `b`), achieving 60–80% bandwidth reduction. Uses `java.time.Instant` for ISO 8601 timestamp parsing with flexible numeric type coercion.
- **FEAT**: `ConfigManager` now reads and applies the following new configuration fields from Dart: `batteryBudgetPerHour` (adaptive battery budget target), `enableSparseUpdates`, `sparseDistanceThreshold`, `sparseMaxIdleSeconds` (app-level deduplication), `enableDeadReckoning`, `deadReckoningActivationDelay`, `deadReckoningMaxDuration` (inertial navigation when GPS lost), `enableDeltaCompression`, `deltaCoordinatePrecision` (HTTP delta encoding), and `disableAutoSyncOnCellular` (WiFi-only sync).
- **FEAT**: `HttpSyncManager` now supports `disableAutoSyncOnCellular` — skips auto-sync when device is on cellular network, syncing only on WiFi. Also conditionally applies `DeltaEncoder.encode()` to multi-location batches before HTTP upload when `enableDeltaCompression` is enabled, reducing upload size by 60–80%.

## 1.0.2

- **FIX**: `destroyAll()` unconditionally removed geofence registrations from Play Services even when `stopOnTerminate: false` was configured with `trackingMode=1` (geofence mode). Geofences now survive app termination and are re-registered on boot/task-removal ([#23](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/23)).

## 1.0.1

- **FIX**: HTTP auto-sync never triggered from automatic location tracking — `onLocationInserted()` was only called from the manual `insertLocation` handler, not from `LocationEngine.persistLocationIfAllowed()` ([#21](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/21)).
- **FIX**: `PeriodicLocationWorker` now triggers HTTP auto-sync after each periodic location insert.

## 1.0.0

### 🎉 Stable Release

- **FEAT**: First stable release of `tracelet_android`.
- **DOCS**: Add Play Store background location declaration guide.
- **REFACTOR**: Remove third-party company name references.
