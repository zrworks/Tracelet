## 2.0.6

- **PERF**: Hardware-level sensor batching on Android reduces CPU wake-ups by over 90% during active accelerometer monitoring.
- **FIX**: iOS `BatteryBudgetEngine` adjustments (distance filter, desired accuracy, periodic interval) are now correctly applied to the location engine.
- **PERF**: iOS Heartbeat deduplication avoids redundant SQLite writes and HTTP sync attempts when stationary.
- **FIX**: Restored fast stationary detection (~5s dwell window) on iOS by correcting sample calculations to match 10Hz accelerometer rate.
- **FEAT**: Added graceful hardware fallback on Android to use `TYPE_SIGNIFICANT_MOTION` when the primary accelerometer is missing.
- **FEAT**: Added explicit permission checks and events upon start when location permissions are missing.
- **CHORE**: Update platform-specific dependency constraints to `^2.0.6`.

## 2.0.5

- **FEAT**: Added `Tracelet.isHeadlessRegistered` static getter. Returns `true` after `registerHeadlessTask()` has been called. Useful for diagnostic tools like `tracelet_doctor` to detect missing headless handlers.
- **CHORE**: New companion package `tracelet_doctor` (v1.0.0) — drop-in diagnostic overlay widget. See [tracelet_doctor](https://pub.dev/packages/tracelet_doctor).

## 2.0.4

- **FEAT**: Integrated Kalman Location Filter GPS smoothing into the Flutter plugin and the dynamic config settings in the Example App.
- **CHORE**: Update platform-specific dependency constraints to `^2.0.4`.

## 2.0.3

- **FIX**: Removed unreliable timestamp drift heuristic from Android and iOS location spoofing detection. This prevents valid locations from being incorrectly rejected when a device's wall-clock time is slightly out of sync with GPS UTC time.

## 2.0.1

- **FIX**: Fixed persistent blue location indicator on iOS by properly conditionally disabling `CLBackgroundActivitySession` and continuous GPS in low-accuracy geofence-only mode.
- **CHORE**: Bumped native SDK dependencies to `2.0.1`.

## 2.0.0

### 🎉 Major Milestone: Tracelet 2.0.0

Tracelet 2.0.0 introduces a modernized configuration schema, robust type-safe platform communication via Pigeon, and a flexible dependency model to optimize app size and compatibility.

### 🚨 Breaking Changes
- **Refactored Configuration**: The `Config` model is now a nested compound structure. Fields are grouped into `GeoConfig`, `AppConfig`, `AndroidConfig`, `HttpConfig`, `LoggerConfig`, `MotionConfig`, `GeofenceConfig`, and `SecurityConfig`.
- **Android On-Demand Dependencies**: Optional features (GMS Location, SQLCipher, Play Integrity) are no longer bundled by default, reducing APK size by ~16 MB. Developers must now explicitly add these to their `android/app/build.gradle` if required.
- **Pigeon Migration**: All platform-to-native communication now uses strictly-typed Pigeon interfaces, improving reliability and eliminating magic string/map errors.
- **Removed Deprecated APIs**: Permission methods that returned raw integers (e.g., `getPermissionStatus`, `requestPermission`) have been removed in favor of the strongly-typed `Future<AuthorizationStatus>` methods introduced in 1.9.0.

### 🛠️ Improvements
- **Motion Sensitivity Tuning**: Added `shakeThreshold`, `stillThreshold`, and `stillSampleCount` to `MotionConfig`, providing granular control over accelerometer-based motion detection across all platforms.
- **iOS Stability**: Resolved a critical issue where native permission dialogs failed to appear by enforcing main-thread execution for all `CoreLocation` and `CoreMotion` requests.
- **Cross-Platform Parity**: Aligned authorization status mapping across Android and iOS to ensure consistent behavior when checking permissions.
- **AOSP Support**: Improved fallback to standard `LocationManager` on Android when Google Play Services are unavailable.

## 1.9.3
2: 
3: - **CHORE**: Bump native SDK dependencies to `1.1.4`.
4: - **CHORE**: Aligned repository podspec files and updated release documentation.
5: 
6: ## 1.9.2

- **REFACTOR**: Migrated `TlTrackingMode` to a strongly-typed enum across the entire Pigeon bridge. This improves type safety and developer experience by eliminating magic integers in the platform communication layer. Android and iOS native implementations now use the generated enum types directly.
- **FIX**: Resolved "Unable to establish connection" regression in `locationStream` when secondary engines (like overlays or background isolates) detach. Ensured `destroyAll()` is correctly integrated into the `primaryInstance` guard on both Android and iOS to prevent resource leaks and duplicate registrations during hot restarts.
- **FIX**: `Tracelet.locationStream` no longer goes silent when `flutter_overlay_window` (or any plugin using `FlutterEngineGroup`) creates a secondary in-process `FlutterEngine`. The primary-instance guard introduced in 1.9.0 (#51) blocked `EventDispatcher` re-binding for in-process overlay engines, causing Pigeon FlutterApi `onLocation` channel to report "Unable to establish connection". A Looper-based discriminator now distinguishes overlay engines (main-thread attach → re-bind dispatcher) from headless background engines (off-thread attach → full skip, preserving #51).
- **FIX**: Android `destroyAll()` now guards all background-critical subsystems when `stopOnTerminate: false` (#65). `httpSyncManager.stop()`, `scheduleManager.stop()`, and `stopHeartbeat()` were still called unconditionally on every swipe-to-dismiss, permanently killing HTTP sync and heartbeat monitoring until the app was manually reopened. Fixed in native `tracelet-sdk` 1.1.2.
- **CHORE**: Aligned `PigeonTracelet` serialization logic to use enum indices for backward compatibility with the high-level `State` model while maintaining type-safe internal bridge contracts.

## 1.9.1

- **FIX**: Android `destroyAll()` now respects `stopOnTerminate: false` for continuous and geofence tracking modes (#63). `locationEngine.destroy()` was unconditionally called in `onDetachedFromEngine()`, racing with `LocationService.onTaskRemoved()` which bootstraps native tracking. Background location tracking now survives app swipe from recents when `stopOnTerminate: false` is configured.

## 1.9.0

- **FEAT**: Strongly typed permission APIs (#57). Added `getLocationAuthorization`, `requestLocationAuthorization`, `getNotificationAuthorization`, `requestNotificationAuthorization`, `getMotionAuthorization`, `requestMotionAuthorization`, and `requestTemporaryFullAccuracyAuthorization`, all returning `Future<AuthorizationStatus>` instead of magic ints. The matching int-returning methods (`getPermissionStatus`, `requestPermission`, `getNotificationPermissionStatus`, `requestNotificationPermission`, `getMotionPermissionStatus`, `requestMotionPermission`, `requestTemporaryFullAccuracy`) are now `@Deprecated` and will be removed in 2.0.0.
- **FIX**: Android `LocationService` no longer crashes the host app with `RemoteServiceException: Context.startForegroundService() did not then call Service.startForeground()` (#59). Reproducible on real devices when using `periodicUseForegroundService: true`. Root cause: `onStartCommand` only promoted to foreground for `ACTION_START`, but the system can deliver intents for other actions (and null-intent sticky restarts after a system kill) under the same foreground-service contract. Fixed in native `tracelet-sdk` 1.1.0 by always promoting at the top of `onStartCommand`.
- **FIX**: `Geofence(extras: {...})` now correctly persists and is returned by `getGeofences()` and delivered in `onGeofence` events (#58). Bug was in `tracelet_platform_interface`'s `_mapToGeofence`, which silently dropped `extras` and `vertices` when constructing the Pigeon payload; the 1.8.12 native fix had no effect because the data never crossed the platform channel. Affected both Android and iOS.
- **TEST**: Added on-device integration test (`example/integration_test/geofence_extras_test.dart`) that round-trips `addGeofence` → `getGeofences()` to prevent regression.

## 1.8.13

- **PERF**: Reduce first-fix latency on stationary → moving transitions on both iOS and Android. The native engines now fire an additional one-shot location request when motion starts, delivering a fresh GPS fix in ~1–5s instead of waiting for `distanceFilter` (iOS) or `locationUpdateInterval` (Android) on the continuous stream (#54).
- **FIX**: Android — after a manual `Tracelet.changePace(false)` (force stationary), the SDK can now detect real motion and resume tracking automatically. Previously the wake-up sensors stayed torn down, leaving the SDK in a dead-state. iOS was unaffected.
- **FIX**: Bump iOS native SDK to 1.0.11 and Android native SDK to 1.0.12.

## 1.8.12

- **FIX**: Geofence `extras` now arrive in `GeofenceEvent.extras` on Android (previously always empty). Location `extras` are also correctly included when reading back persisted locations (#51 follow-up).
- **FIX**: Bump Android native SDK to 1.0.11.

## 1.8.11

- **FIX**: Geofence callbacks no longer silently stop during continuous tracking when a secondary FlutterEngine (e.g. Firebase background messaging) registers the plugin (#51).

## 1.8.10

- **FIX**: Killed-state tracking now works reliably — `stopBootTracking()` deferred from `initialize()` to `ready()` so boot-mode native tracking survives until the Dart side explicitly takes over (#50).
- **FIX**: Bump native SDKs to 1.0.10.

## 1.8.9

- **FEAT**: Add `syncInterval` to `HttpConfig` — flush locations on a fixed timer instead of per-insert, for fleet/logistics use cases (#50).
- **FEAT**: Bump native SDKs to 1.0.9.

## 1.8.8

- **FIX**: HTTP sync payload now consistent between iOS and Android — Android `cursorToLocation()` and all location map producers now use canonical `is_moving` (snake_case) and ISO 8601 timestamps, matching iOS format (#48).
- **FIX**: Bump native SDKs to 1.0.8.

## 1.8.7

- **FIX**: Re-release of 1.8.6 fixes (1.8.6 was partially published to pub.dev without all fixes).
- **FIX**: Bump native SDKs to 1.0.7.

## 1.8.6

- **FIX**: `getCurrentPosition(samples: 1)` now forces a fresh GPS fix instead of returning stale cached locations — uses `requestLocationUpdates`/`startUpdatingLocation` instead of `getCurrentLocation`/`requestLocation` which may return cached data without waking GPS hardware (#46).
- **FIX**: HTTP sync headers callback (`setHeadersCallback`) no longer invoked per-batch — eliminates unnecessary MethodChannel round-trip latency on every sync request. Token refresh now handled exclusively via `setTokenRefreshCallback` on 401.
- **FIX**: Headless `FlutterEngine` no longer overwrites foreground `httpSyncManager` callbacks — fixes 10-second timeout on `requestFreshHeaders` caused by MethodChannel messages routed to the wrong Dart isolate.
- **FIX**: Bump native SDKs to 1.0.6.
- **FIX**: Privacy zones, audit trail, and encryption APIs now work before `ready()` — only require `initialize()` (DB creation), not active tracking.
- **FIX**: `getPrivacyZones()` no longer throws `_Map<Object?, Object?>` type cast error — fix Pigeon-generated lazy cast for nested map types.

## 1.8.5

- **FIX**: `getCurrentPosition()` falls back to last known location when GPS returns no fix (e.g. emulator, GPS-off) — fixes `LOCATION_UNAVAILABLE` errors (#46).
- **FIX**: Bump native SDKs to 1.0.5.

## 1.8.4

- **FIX**: Add `isReady` guards to all Android SDK methods — prevents `UninitializedPropertyAccessException` when called before `ready()` (re-fixes #46).
- **FIX**: Pin native SDK dependencies to exact versions — prevents auto-resolving to incompatible newer native SDK releases.

## 1.8.3

- **FIX**: Prevent crash when `getState()`, `setConfig()`, or any other method is called before `ready()` on iOS — comprehensive `isReady` guards across all native SDK methods (re-fixes #46).

## 1.8.2

- **FIX**: Prevent crash when `stop()` is called before `ready()` on iOS — returns `NOT_READY` error instead of accessing uninitialized properties.
- **FIX**: Guard `soundManager` access on Android to prevent `UninitializedPropertyAccessException` during motion state changes or cleanup.
- **FIX**: Use `LocationManagerCompat.isLocationEnabled()` on Android — fixes `NoSuchMethodError` crash on API 26/27 devices.
- **FIX**: Enterprise optional dependencies (SQLCipher, Play Integrity, security-crypto) now gracefully degrade at runtime when not on the classpath — no more `NoClassDefFoundError` crashes.
- **REFACTOR**: Refined ProGuard/R8 consumer rules — narrower keep rules, added `-dontwarn` for optional enterprise dependencies.
- **DOCS**: Updated `INSTALL-ANDROID.md` and `DATABASE-ENCRYPTION.md` with enterprise dependency setup instructions.

## 1.8.1

- **TEST**: Add 25 Dart location map format tests.
- **DOCS**: Add `help/LOCATION-MAP-FORMAT.md` canonical format contract reference.

## 1.7.1

- **FIX**: ConfigManager null-merge — partial `setConfig()` no longer overwrites existing values with null defaults (fixes periodic mode HTTP sync failure).
- **FEAT**: Add `Tracelet.destroySyncedLocations()` — deletes only synced locations, returns count deleted.
- **FEAT**: Auto-purge synced locations from database after successful HTTP sync.

## 1.7.0

- **FEAT**: Migrate all event subscriptions from EventChannels to Pigeon FlutterApi platform streams.
- **FEAT**: Add `Location.fromTl` and `LocationActivity.fromTl` factory constructors for Pigeon type conversion.

## 1.6.2

- **FIX**: Update `tracelet_web` dependency to `^1.6.1` — fixes 5 missing HTTP Sync method stubs that caused `UnimplementedError` on web.

## 1.6.1

- **FEAT**: Add 401-aware retry — native HTTP sync now detects 401 responses, invokes the headless headers callback (`registerHeadlessHeadersCallback`) to refresh authorization tokens, and retries the request once with updated dynamic headers. Works in both foreground and killed-state (headless) modes.

## 1.6.0

- **FEAT**: Add SSL certificate pinning via `HttpConfig.sslPinningCertificates` and `HttpConfig.sslPinningFingerprints`.
- **FEAT**: Add dynamic HTTP headers — `setDynamicHeaders()`, `setHeadersCallback()`, `refreshHeaders()`, and headless `registerHeadlessHeadersCallback()`.

- **TEST**: Add 5 unit tests for `reducedAccuracy` field (default, parse, snake_case, round-trip, copyWithCoords).
- **CHORE**: Update cross-package dependency constraints to `^1.4.4`.

## 1.4.3

- **FEAT**: Add `locationSource` field to `Location` — classifies each fix as `gps`, `wifi`, `cell`, `network`, or `unknown`.
- **FEAT**: Add `gpsFallback` field to `ProviderChangeEvent` — signals when the engine auto-downgrades to Wi-Fi/cell positioning because GPS is disabled.
- **CHORE**: Update cross-package dependency constraints to `^1.4.3`.

## 1.4.2

- **FIX**: Dead reckoning activation now reliably detects GPS hardware state instead of using accuracy-based heuristic.
- **FIX**: Mock detection heuristic no longer produces false positives for Wi-Fi/cell locations when GPS is disabled.
- **CHORE**: Update cross-package dependency constraints to `^1.4.2`.

## 1.4.1

- **FEAT**: Dead reckoning — full native IMU sensor fusion for GPS-denied environments (tunnels, parking structures, urban canyons). Activates automatically on GPS loss, deactivates on GPS recovery.
- **CHORE**: Update cross-package dependency constraints to `^1.4.1`.

## 1.4.0

- **FEAT**: Encrypted SQLite — `Tracelet.isDatabaseEncrypted()` and `Tracelet.encryptDatabase()` for at-rest database encryption (SQLCipher on Android, Data Protection on iOS).
- **FEAT**: Device attestation — `Tracelet.getAttestationToken()` returns a platform attestation token (Play Integrity on Android, App Attest on iOS).
- **FEAT**: Remote config — automatic fetch of remote configuration with ETag caching and `onRemoteConfig` event stream.
- **FEAT**: Dead reckoning — `Tracelet.getDeadReckoningState()` stub for future accelerometer/gyroscope-based position estimation.
- **FEAT**: Carbon estimator — `Tracelet.getCarbonReport()` returns CO₂ emission estimates from tracked journeys.
- **FEAT**: Add `SecurityConfig` and `AttestationConfig` to `Config` model for enterprise feature configuration.
- **CHORE**: Update cross-package dependency constraints to `^1.4.0`.

## 1.3.7

- **FIX**: Android — fix `ClassNotFoundException` crash on app upgrade for `BootReceiver` and other manifest-declared components (fixes #31).
- **CHORE**: Update `tracelet_android` dependency constraint to `^1.3.7`.

## 1.3.6

- **FIX**: `SQLQuery.start` and `SQLQuery.end` now correctly filter locations on all platforms (Android, iOS, Web).
- **FIX**: Add `offset` field to `SQLQuery` to match native handler expectations.
- **FIX**: `getCount()` now accepts optional `SQLQuery` for time-bounded counting.
- **PERF**: `DeltaEncoder.encode` is 2.1x faster (cached DateTime parsing, precomputed rounding factors).

- **FIX**: Android — bundle native core Kotlin source (`com.tracelet.core.*`) directly inside the plugin package, fixing "Unresolved reference" build errors when installed from pub.dev.
- **FIX**: iOS — bundle TraceletCore Swift source directly inside the plugin package instead of depending on an unpublished local CocoaPod.
- **CHORE**: Remove React Native support to simplify the monorepo.

## 1.3.2

- **PERF**: Android — streaming `JsonWriter` replaces per-location `JSONObject` allocations in batch sync (A-L5).
- **PERF**: iOS — C-level UUID generation replaces Foundation `UUID()` in `LocationEngine` and `TraceletDatabase` (I-M6).
- **PERF**: Performance audit now 77/77 items resolved (100%).

## 1.3.1

- **FIX**: Resolve `extras` key collision between `HttpConfig` and `PersistenceConfig` — serialization keys renamed to `httpExtras` and `persistenceExtras` to prevent native ConfigManager flat-merge from overwriting one with the other. Backward-compatible via `fromMap` fallback.
- **PERF**: Add 22 new benchmarks covering DeltaEncoder, BatteryBudgetEngine, CarbonEstimator, PersistDecider, Config/State serialization.
- **PERF**: iOS `markSynced()` now uses chunked prepared statements (500 UUIDs/chunk) to avoid SQLite variable limit and improve sync performance.

## 1.3.0

- **FIX**: `getState()` always returned `enabled: false` on iOS — the iOS `StateManager.toMap()` flat-merged config keys into the state dictionary, overwriting `enabled` and `isMoving` with config defaults. Fixed by nesting config under a `"config"` key, matching Android behavior ([#26](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/26)).

## 1.2.0

### Breaking Changes

- **REFACTOR**: `ForegroundServiceConfig.notificationPriority` changed from `int` to `NotificationPriority` enum. Replace raw integers (`-2`..`2`) with enum values (`NotificationPriority.min`, `.low`, `.defaultPriority`, `.high`, `.max`).
- **REFACTOR**: `AuditConfig.hashAlgorithm` changed from `String` to `HashAlgorithm` enum. Replace `'SHA-256'` with `HashAlgorithm.sha256`, `'SHA-512'` with `HashAlgorithm.sha512`, etc.
- **REFACTOR**: `MotionConfig.triggerActivities` changed from comma-separated `String` to `Set<ActivityType>`. Replace `'on_foot, in_vehicle'` with `{ActivityType.onFoot, ActivityType.inVehicle}`.

### Notes

- Native platform channel serialization is backward-compatible — no native code changes required. `notificationPriority` still serializes as int, `hashAlgorithm` as `"SHA-256"` string, and `triggerActivities` as comma-separated string.

## 1.1.0

### New Features

- **FEAT**: Add `ComplianceReport` model and `Tracelet.generateComplianceReport()` API for GDPR Article 30 / CCPA data processing inventory reports. Auto-generates a structured snapshot of all location data collection metadata including: `totalLocationsStored`, `totalLocationsSynced`, data retention policy (`maxDaysToPersist`, `maxRecordsToPersist`), timestamp bounds of stored records (`oldestRecord`, `newestRecord`), database encryption status, active privacy zone count and identifiers, HTTP sync URL and auto-sync state, audit trail status with chain validation, permission states (location + motion), and tracking configuration flags (sparse updates, Kalman filter, delta compression, tracking mode). Supports `toJson()` for automated tooling integration and `toMarkdown()` for human-readable audit documents.
- **FEAT**: Add `BatteryBudgetEngine` algorithm — a feedback control loop that automatically adjusts `distanceFilter`, `desiredAccuracy`, and periodic interval to maintain a configurable battery budget. Set `batteryBudgetPerHour` in `GeoConfig` (typical range: 1.0–5.0 %/hr) to enable. Subscribe to `Tracelet.onBudgetAdjustment()` for real-time adjustment events showing current drain vs. target and the new parameters being applied.
- **FEAT**: Add `CarbonEstimator` — per-trip and cumulative CO₂ emission calculator using EU EEA 2024 mode-specific emission factors (gCO₂/km): car = 192, bus = 89, train = 41, walking/cycling = 0. Integrates with activity recognition to track distance per transport mode via Haversine. Returns `TripCarbonSummary` with `totalCarbonGrams`, `totalDistanceMeters`, `carbonByMode`, `distanceByMode`, and `dominantMode`. Tracks cumulative totals across trips.
- **FEAT**: Add `DeltaEncoder` algorithm — batch location compression codec using delta encoding with 60–80% payload reduction. First location transmitted in full; subsequent positions as deltas with shortened field names and configurable coordinate precision (5 = ~1.1 m, 6 = ~0.11 m). Native implementations provided on Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift) for consistency.
- **FEAT**: Add `RTree<T>` spatial index — O(log n) geofence proximity queries supporting 10,000+ geofences with sub-millisecond lookup. Provides `queryCircle()` and `queryBBox()` APIs with Haversine-verified results.

### New Configuration Fields

- **FEAT**: `GeoConfig.batteryBudgetPerHour` (`double`, default `0.0`) — target max battery drain (%/hr). When > 0, enables `BatteryBudgetEngine` which auto-adjusts accuracy, distance filter, and sample rate. Overrides manual settings.
- **FEAT**: `GeoConfig.enableSparseUpdates` (`bool`, default `false`) — app-level deduplication that drops locations within `sparseDistanceThreshold` (default 50 m) of the last recorded position. Unlike `distanceFilter` (which controls platform GPS sampling), this filters at the persistence layer. `sparseMaxIdleSeconds` (default 300) forces periodic "still here" updates.
- **FEAT**: `GeoConfig.enableDeadReckoning` (`bool`, default `false`) — inertial navigation using accelerometer + gyroscope + compass when GPS is lost for longer than `deadReckoningActivationDelay` seconds (default 10). Auto-stops after `deadReckoningMaxDuration` seconds (default 120) to prevent IMU drift accumulation.
- **FEAT**: `HttpConfig.enableDeltaCompression` (`bool`, default `false`) — enable delta encoding for batch HTTP syncs. `deltaCoordinatePrecision` (default 6) controls coordinate precision.
- **FEAT**: `HttpConfig.disableAutoSyncOnCellular` (`bool`, default `false`) — skip auto-sync on cellular networks, only sync on WiFi. Supported on Android, iOS, and Web (via Network Information API).
- **FEAT**: `GeoConfig.enableAdaptiveMode` (`bool`, default `false`) — dynamic sampling based on activity type + battery level + charging state. Activity profiles: still → 500 m, walking → 50 m, driving → 10 m; battery scaling progressively widens filter below 50%/20%/10%.
- **FEAT**: Periodic mode configuration: `periodicLocationInterval` (60–43200 sec), `periodicDesiredAccuracy`, `periodicUseForegroundService` (Android — sub-15-min intervals), `periodicUseExactAlarms` (Android — `AlarmManager` precision).

### Bug Fixes

- **FIX**: `generateComplianceReport()` and `getHealthCheck()` no longer crash with `type 'Map<Object?, Object?>' is not a subtype of type 'Map<String, Object?>'` errors. Platform channel maps are now safely converted via `Map<String, Object?>.from()` instead of direct `as` casts. Also fixed nested config sub-map casts (`config`, `geo`, `http`, `audit`, `persistence`) using null-safe `is Map` checks.

### Infrastructure

- **CHORE**: Migrate melos configuration from standalone `melos.yaml` to `pubspec.yaml` under the `melos:` key for melos 7.x compatibility. All 13 scripts (analyze, format, format:fix, test, test:dart, pigeon, clean, pub:get, build:example:android/ios/web, coverage, benchmark) now run via `melos run <name>`.
- **CHORE**: Adopt Dart pub workspaces — root `pubspec.yaml` declares `workspace:` listing all 6 packages; each package declares `resolution: workspace`. Removed 5 `pubspec_overrides.yaml` files that are no longer needed.
- **CHORE**: Upgrade melos dependency from `^6.0.0` to `^7.0.0`.

## 1.0.2

- **FIX**: (Android/iOS) Geofence registrations were unconditionally destroyed on app termination and reset, even when `stopOnTerminate: false` was configured with `trackingMode=1`. Geofences now survive process death and are properly re-registered ([#23](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/23)).

## 1.0.1

- **FIX**: HTTP auto-sync was not triggered during automatic location tracking on any platform — locations accumulated in the database without being synced to the server ([#21](https://github.com/Ikolvi/Tracelet/issues/21)).
- **FIX**: (iOS) `HttpMethod.put` was silently ignored due to type mismatch in native config parsing.
- **FIX**: (iOS) HTTP headers could be dropped when platform channel delivered mixed-type maps.
- **FIX**: (iOS) `maxBatchSize` default corrected from 100 to 250.

## 1.0.0

### 🎉 Stable Release

- **FEAT**: First stable release of `tracelet` — production-grade background geolocation for Flutter.
- **DOCS**: Add Play Store background location declaration guide.
- **REFACTOR**: Remove third-party company name references — use generic `flutter_background_geolocation` throughout.
- **REFACTOR**: Rename migration guide to `MIGRATION-FROM-FBG.md`.
- All APIs are finalized and production-ready.

## 0.12.0

### Performance Audit — 74 of 77 issues resolved

- **PERF**: Add `Location.copyWithCoords()` to eliminate `toMap()/fromMap()` round-trip in Kalman filter hot path (D-C2).
- **PERF**: Wire trip detection to processed location stream, eliminating duplicate `Location.fromMap()` (D-H1).
- **PERF**: Fast-path `_castToMap` with type check — avoids map copy when already correct type (D-H2).
- **PERF**: Replace `.expand()` with `.where()` in `_filterLocation` to avoid single-element list allocations (D-H4).
- **PERF**: Cancel adaptive activity subscription in `removeListeners()` (D-H7).
- **PERF**: Use `.toList(growable: false)` for `addGeofences`/`addPrivacyZones` result lists (D-M6).
- **PERF**: Invalidate cached stream pipeline on `setConfig()` so it rebuilds with new settings (D-M8).
- **PERF**: Use `Map.from()` instead of `.map()` with `MapEntry` for extras in `Location.fromMap()` (D-L4).
- **REFACTOR**: Deduplicate `LocationProcessor` parameter list in `setConfig()` (D-L5).

## 0.11.5

- **FIX**: [Android/iOS] Polygon geofence `vertices` are now correctly persisted to the native SQLite databases. Previously, vertex data was silently dropped during `addGeofence()`, causing polygon geofences to revert to circular after app restart.

## 0.11.4

- **FIX**: [iOS] Revert over-aggressive permission guards — When In Use permission now works correctly for all tracking modes. Only the killed-state auto-resume (`autoResumeTracking`) requires Always authorization. iOS enforces permission at the OS level.

## 0.11.3

- **FIX**: [Android] Enforce `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` check on all killed-state restart paths (boot receiver, task removal, periodic alarms/workers). "While In Use" permission no longer triggers background tracking.
- **FIX**: [iOS] Enforce `.authorizedAlways` check on killed-state auto-resume and guard `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates`. "When In Use" permission no longer triggers tracking from killed state.- **FEAT**: Add `Tracelet.hasBackgroundPermission` static getter — convenience check that returns `true` when location permission is `AuthorizationStatus.always`.
## 0.11.2

* **FIX**: Web EventChannel bridge — all event streams (`onLocation`, `onMotionChange`, `onHeartbeat`, etc.) were broken on web due to events being consumed but never forwarded. Now works correctly.
* **CHORE**: Bump `tracelet_ios` to ^0.8.1, `tracelet_web` to ^0.8.1.

## 0.8.0
